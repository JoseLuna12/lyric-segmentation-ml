# Attention Settings in Training Results

## Overview

The attention mechanism settings are now properly included in the training results and session comparison outputs.

## Where Attention Settings Appear

### 1. **During Training Start**
All attention settings are printed in the configuration summary:
```
üéØ Attention: localized type, 4 heads, dropout=0.15
    üîç Localized: window_size=7
    ‚úÖ Positional encoding enabled (max_len=1000)
```

### 2. **Final Results File** (`final_results.txt`)
Added to the Model Architecture section:
```
Model Architecture:
------------------
  Input dimension: 60D
  Hidden dimension: 256D
  LSTM layers: 2
  ‚úÖ Multi-layer BiLSTM architecture
      Inter-layer dropout: 0.35
      Total parameters: 123,456
  Attention type: localized
    Window size: 7
  Positional encoding: True
    PE max length: 1000
  Output dropout: 0.18
```

### 3. **Session Comparison Script**
When using `scripts/compare_sessions.py --detail session_name`:
```
üß† Attention Configuration:
   Attention type: localized
   Window size: 7
   Positional encoding: True
```

## Attention Types Supported

### Self Attention (Default)
```yaml
attention_type: self
positional_encoding: true
```

### Localized Attention
```yaml
attention_type: localized
window_size: 7
positional_encoding: true
```

### Boundary-Aware Attention
```yaml
attention_type: boundary_aware
boundary_temperature: 2.0
positional_encoding: true
```

## Benefits

1. **Full Traceability**: Every training session records which attention mechanism was used
2. **Easy Comparison**: Session comparison scripts show attention settings for quick analysis
3. **Reproducibility**: Complete attention configuration preserved in training snapshots
4. **Documentation**: Human-readable format in final results files

## Usage Examples

### Training with Different Attention Types
```bash
# Localized attention
python train_with_config.py configs/training/bilstm_localized_attention.yaml

# Boundary-aware attention
python train_with_config.py configs/training/bilstm_boundary_aware_attention.yaml
```

### Comparing Sessions
```bash
# Overview of all sessions
python scripts/compare_sessions.py

# Detailed view including attention settings
python scripts/compare_sessions.py --detail session_20250819_123456_localized_v1
```

## Configuration Files

The production-ready configurations include complete attention settings:
- `configs/training/bilstm_localized_attention.yaml`
- `configs/training/bilstm_boundary_aware_attention.yaml`

Both configurations maintain the proven baseline architecture while adding configurable attention mechanisms.
