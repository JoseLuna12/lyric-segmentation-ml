# Validation Strategy Experiments

Documentation of 4 training experiments comparing different validation strategies for model selection.

**Date Range:** August 17, 2025  
**Configuration:** All experiments used identical architecture (256D hidden, 60D features, 24 batch size)  
**Goal:** Determine optimal validation strategy for structural understanding

## ðŸ“Š **Key Insights**

### ðŸ¥‡ **Boundary F1 Strategy (WINNER)**
- **Best overall performance**: Highest boundary F1 (0.441) and line-level metrics
- **Longest training**: 37.2 minutes - model had time to optimize structural understanding
- **Balanced learning**: Strong both in line classification (84.3%) and boundary detection
- **Verdict**: Direct optimization of boundary detection produces best structural results

### ðŸ¥ˆ **Composite Strategy (RUNNER-UP)**  
- **Best transition detection**: Highest verseâ†’chorus accuracy (51.9%) and complete segments (28.9%)
- **Efficient training**: Reasonable time (19.5 min) with good structural metrics
- **Balanced approach**: Combines multiple metrics effectively
- **Verdict**: Good balance between efficiency and structural understanding

### ðŸ”¶ **WindowDiff Strategy**
- **Conservative approach**: Focuses on forgiving boundary evaluation
- **Moderate results**: Middle-ground performance across all metrics
- **Early stopping**: Stopped earlier, missing potential improvements
- **Verdict**: Too forgiving - doesn't push model to achieve precise boundaries

### ðŸ”¶ **Segment IoU Strategy**
- **Fastest training**: Only 13.9 minutes - stopped too early
- **Segment focus**: Good complete segment detection (26.2%) despite short training
- **Underperformed**: Lowest line-level and boundary metrics
- **Verdict**: Early convergence prevented full potential

## ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusions**

1. **Boundary F1 validation strategy is optimal** - directly optimizes the structural understanding we need
2. **Training time matters** - longer training (37+ min) allows architectural convergence  
3. **Composite strategy is efficient alternative** - best transition accuracy with reasonable training time
4. **Segment IoU stops too early** - needs patience parameter adjustment
5. **All strategies show similar boundary F1 range** (~0.37-0.44) - architectural limitations remain

## ðŸš€ **Recommendations**

**Primary:** Use `validation_strategy: "boundary_f1"` as default  
**Alternative:** Use `validation_strategy: "composite"` for faster iteration cycles  
**Next Steps:** Architectural improvements needed - all strategies plateau around 0.44 boundary F1

*These experiments validated Phase 5 completion and informed the prioritization of architectural enhancements (Phase 1-2) in the improvement plan.*
