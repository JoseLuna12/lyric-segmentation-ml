# CNN Model Stability Fixes

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to prevent CNN training collapse and NaN issues.

## 1. Weight Initialization

### CNNTagger
- Changed `xavier_uniform_` with large gain to `normal_` with small std=0.02
- Changed classifier initialization to even smaller std=0.01
- Added bias toward verse (0.02) to prevent collapse to chorus
- Added conservative weight clamping (-0.5 to 0.5) during initialization

### CNNBlock
- Changed convolution initialization from `xavier_uniform_` to `normal_` with std=0.02
- Set small positive bias (0.01) for all layers instead of zero
- Initialized residual projection weights with even smaller std=0.01
- Proper BatchNorm initialization

## 2. Architecture Changes

### CNNBlock
- Replaced GELU activation with more stable ReLU
- Replaced LayerNorm with BatchNorm1d (more suitable for CNN)
- Fixed padding calculation for odd and even kernel sizes
- Added residual scaling (0.1) to prevent gradient explosion

## 3. Forward Pass Stability

### CNNTagger Forward
- Added NaN/Inf detection for input features
- Added value clipping after projection (-10 to 10)
- Added NaN detection and fallback between CNN blocks
- Added try-except with fallback for attention
- Added final value clipping before classification
- Added gradient clipping hooks
- Added logits clipping (-20 to 20)

### CNNBlock Forward
- Added NaN/Inf detection for inputs
- Added pre-normalization for stability
- Added value clipping for convolution outputs
- Added value clipping for projection outputs
- Added residual connection scaling (0.1)
- Fixed BatchNorm1d application with proper transposing
- Added gradient clipping hooks during training

## 4. Training Loop Safeguards

### CNNTrainer
- Added NaN/Inf checks for logits
- Added NaN/Inf checks for loss values
- Enhanced gradient monitoring with aggressive clipping
- Added NaN safety check for early stopping metrics
- More aggressive emergency monitoring for CNN-specific issues

## Impact

These changes work together to prevent common CNN training issues:

1. **Initialization**: Smaller initialization prevents gradient explosion in early training
2. **Architecture**: BatchNorm and ReLU provide more stability than LayerNorm and GELU
3. **Forward Pass**: Value clipping and NaN checks prevent error propagation
4. **Training Loop**: Additional safeguards catch and handle issues before they cause collapse

The most critical fixes are the residual scaling (0.1) and the much smaller initialization values, as these address the root cause of most gradient explosion problems in CNN models.
