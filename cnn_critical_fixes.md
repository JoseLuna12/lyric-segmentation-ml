# Critical CNN Training Fixes

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to resolve the `loss=nan, grad_norm=nan, chorus%=0.00` issues.

## 1. Initialization Improvements

### Fixed Classifier Bias
- **Problem**: Artificial class bias toward verse class (0.0 vs 0.02) can cause immediate instability
- **Fix**: Initialized both biases to zero for class neutrality
```python
self.classifier.bias.fill_(0.0)  # Neutral initialization
```

### Removed Aggressive Parameter Clamping
- **Problem**: Parameter clamping (-0.5, 0.5) destroys carefully designed initialization
- **Fix**: Removed parameter clamping to let initialization work naturally
```python
# Removed: param.data.clamp_(-0.5, 0.5)
```

## 2. Architecture Improvements

### Fixed Residual Connections
- **Problem**: Scaling residual connections (0.05 or 0.1) breaks residual learning
- **Fix**: Use standard residual connections without scaling
```python
x = x + residual  # Standard residual connection
```

### Replaced BatchNorm with LayerNorm
- **Problem**: BatchNorm1d with transposing adds complexity and potential instability
- **Fix**: Use LayerNorm which is better suited for sequence data
```python
self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim)
# In forward: x = self.layer_norm(x)  # No transposing needed
```

## 3. Training Loop Safeguards

### Enhanced NaN Detection
- Added comprehensive tensor checking with detailed statistics
- Added NaN gradient detection before clipping
- Added NaN zeroing for recovery

### Conservative Gradient Clipping
- **Problem**: Default gradient clipping was insufficient
- **Fix**: Use more conservative gradient clipping (max 0.5)
```python
clip_value = min(0.5, self.config.gradient_clip_norm)
```

### Learning Rate Warning
- Added warning for high learning rates
- Recommended using lower learning rates (1e-4 to 5e-4) for CNN stability

## 4. Additional Stabilization

### Added Try-Except Blocks
- Added comprehensive exception handling in forward pass
- Added fallback mechanisms for all operations that might fail

### Pre-Normalization
- Added input normalization to stabilize forward pass
- Ensures input to each component is well-conditioned

These fixes address the core issues causing the training collapse. The most critical fixes are:
1. Fixing the classifier bias initialization
2. Removing aggressive parameter clamping
3. Using proper residual connections
4. Enhanced NaN detection and handling throughout the pipeline
