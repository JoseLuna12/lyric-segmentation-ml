# BiLSTM Architecture Improvement Plan

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

**Current Architecture:**
- BiLSTM: 60D features → 512D hidden → 2 classes
- Batch size: 8 (too small)
- Simple ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling 
- No positional encoding, attention, or multi-scale processing
- Results: Macro F1: 0.8308, but concerning confidence patterns

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. ❌ Training configuration problems (batch size, LR scheduling)
2. ❌ Insufficient evaluation metrics (only token-level F1)
3. ❌ Confidence calibration issues (48% conf>90%, 21% conf>95%)
4. ❌ Architecture limitations (no positional encoding, single-scale, no attention)

**🎯 Phase 3 Key Insight: Validation Strategy Selection**

The most critical outcome of Phase 3 is the shift from line-level F1 to **boundary F1** as our primary validation strategy for model selection and early stopping. Here's why this matters:

- **Previous approach**: Used `val_macro_f1` (line-level accuracy) for early stopping
- **Current approach**: Uses `validation_strategy: "boundary_f1"` for model selection
- **Impact**: Models are now optimized for structural understanding rather than just line classification

**🔧 Implementation Details:**
```yaml
# Configuration (configs/training/aggressive_config.yaml)
validation_strategy: "boundary_f1"  # Optimizes for section boundary detection
```

**📊 Training Output:**
```
📊 Epoch 1 Summary:
  📐 Segmentation: WindowDiff=0.318, Pk=0.318
  🎯 Validation Strategy: boundary_f1 = 0.0401
  ✅ New best boundary_f1: 0.0401
```

**🎉 Result**: The model now stops training when it achieves the best structural understanding (boundary detection F1), not just when it can classify individual lines correctly. This addresses the core issue revealed in Phase 2 where models could achieve high line-level F1 but completely fail at detecting section boundaries.
