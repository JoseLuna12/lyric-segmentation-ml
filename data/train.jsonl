{"id":"training_data_0670","lines":[",","Venom its essence, around the world it goes.\"","The Early Lives of the Saints have parallel references. In an eighth-century chronicle concerning St Fechin, we hear of evil powers and influences whose rage is \"seen in that watery fury, and their hellish hate and turbulence in the beating of the sea against the rocks.\" Pious men are often afraid to approach the shore, fearing to encounter the like hellish influence. Of a great storm we read of \"the waves rising higher and higher-Satan himself doubtless assisting from beneath.\" 3 The Life of the Irish Saint Abban tells how from his ship he saw a beastly monster on the sea, having a hundred heads of divers forms, two hundred eyes, and as many ears; it extended itself to the clouds and set the waters in such commotion that the ship was almost lost. The sailors feared greatly. St Abban prayed against the monster, the beast fell as if dead, and there was a calm. But strange to relate, the body of the monster could be seen neither on sea nor on land (et in hoc apparet quod dyabolus fuit). 1 In Adamnan's Life of Colum-Cille 2 there is a chapter concerning the repulse of a certain aquatic monster (aquatilis bestia) by the blessed man's prayer. The incident occurred somewhere by the river Ness. The inhabitants were burying one who had been bitten while swimming. To fetch a coble from the opposite bank, one of Columba's companions, Lugne Mocumin, cast himself into the water. And Adamnan relates:-","\"But the monster, which was lying in the river bed, and whose appetite was rather whetted for more prey than sated with what it already had, perceiving the surface of the water disturbed by the swimmer, suddenly comes up and moves towards the man as he swam in mid-stream, and with a great roar rushes on him with open mouth, while all who were there, barbarians as well as brethren, were greatly terror-struck. The blessed man seeing it, after making the Salutary sign of the cross in the empty air with his holy hand upraised, and invoking the name of God, commanded the ferocious monster, saying: 'Go thou no further, nor touch the man; go back at once.' Then, on hearing this word of the saint, the monster was terrified, and fled away again more quickly than if it had been dragged off by ropes, though it had approached Lugne as he swam so closely that between man and monster there was no more than the length of one punt pole.\"","The whole incident reflects some natural fact, together with the human belief in the possible occurrence of such. \"The belief,\" says Bishop Reeves, \"that certain rivers and lakes were haunted by serpents of a demoniacal and terrible character was current among the Irish at a very remote period, and still prevails in many parts of Ireland.\" St Molua and St Colman of Dromore are recorded to have saved people from such monsters. As to the modern Irish belief, let Mr W. R. Le Fanu's Seventy Years of Irish Life be evidence:-","\"The dreadful beast, the wurrum-half fish, half dragon-still survives in many a mountain lake-seldom seen, indeed, but often heard. Near our fishing quarters in Kerry there are two such lakes, one the beautiful little lake at the head of the Blackwater River, called Lough Brin, from Brin or Bran as he is now called, the dreadful wurrum which inhabits it. The man who minds the boat there speaks with awe of Bran; he tells me he has never seen him, and hopes he never may, but has often heard him roaring on a stormy night. On being questioned what the noise was like, he said it was like the roaring of a young bull.' ... Some miles further on, between Lough Brin and Glencar, there is another lake from which a boy while bathing was driven and chased by the dreadful wurrum which dwells in it. It bit him on the back and hunted him all the way home, where he arrived naked and bleeding.\"","In the Life of St Mochua of Balla it is recounted that no one ventured to pursue a wounded stag that fled to an island in Lough Ree, on account of a horrible monster that infested the lake and was wont to destroy swimmers. A man was at last persuaded to swim across, but as he was returning the beast devoured him.","In the Altus of St Colum-Cille he refers to a great slimy dragon, terrible and most horrible, that slimy serpent more subtle than all the beasts:-","\"Draco magnus deterrimus terribilis et antiquus qui fuit serpens lubricus sapientior omnibus bestiis... .\"","Nor is a similar belief yet extinct in the Highlands. The late Miss Dempster of Skibo records in her manuscript a legend of St Gilbert and the Dragon, with a note that some say that this was not a dragon, but a witch from Lochlin-a variant to be expected in Sutherland:-","\"There lived once upon a time in Sutherland a great dragon, very fierce and strong. It was this dragon that burnt all the fir woods in Ross, Sutherland, and the Reay country, of which the remains, charred, blackened, and half-decayed, may be found in every moss. Magnificent forests they must have been, but the dragon set fire to them with his fiery breath, and rolled over the whole land.","Men fled from before his face, and women fainted when his shadow crossed the sky-line. He made the whole land desert. And it came to pass that this evil spirit, whom the people called the 'beast' and 'Dubh Giuthais,' 1 came nigh to Dornoch as near as Lochfinn, and when he could see the town and spire of St Gilbert, his church-'Pity of you, Dornoch,' roared the dragon. 'Pity of you, Dornoch,' said St Gilbert, and taking with him five long and sharp arrows, and a little lad to carry them, he went out to meet the 'beast.' When he came over against it he said, 'Pity of you,' and drew his bow. The first arrow shot the beast through the heart. He was buried by the towns-people. Men are alive now who reckoned distance by so or so far from the 'stone of the beast' on the moor between Skibo and Dornoch. The moor is planted, and a wood called Carmore waves over the ashes of the destroying dragon.\"","This church, Miss Dempster notes, was built between 1235-45, burnt 1570, and rebuilt 1614; it was repaired in 1835 by the Duchess, Countess of Sutherland. While the work was going forward the tomb of the founder, Gilbert, Bishop of Caitness, called St Gilbert, was discovered. The saying went in Sutherland that when this happened, the cathedral would fall at mid-day the following Sunday; and Mrs Dempster well remembered seeing a third of the congregation (Gaelic) camped out on the hill above the town, expecting to see the fall of the roof; nor did many of the oldest inhabitants go to church for several following Sundays.","In addition to legends of the beithir-nimh (venomous serpent) and uile-bheist (dragon; also a’ bheisd), there are endless tales of the water-horse (each-uisge) associated with Highland lochs. There is hardly a district without some legend of a Linne na Baobh (Badhbh): very often the water-horse is represented as a kind of creature covered all over with rags and ribbons, typifying the wind-tossed surface of the waves. His appearance is a portent of a drowning soon to follow.","I n the poem of Tristan and Iseult, by Gottfried of Strassburg, a German poet who wrote about the year 1210, working on sources found by him in a poem by Thomas of Brittany, there is an account of the fight with the dragon, strangely analogous to that in Highland tradition. The hero overcomes a monster, and is about to be robbed of the credit of his exploit by a traitor who claims the princess as his guerdon. It is a widespread Aryan tale. A similar adventure is ascribed to Lancelot in Le cerf au pied blanc, and in the Dutch poem of Morien. At least three of the printed prose versions of Tristan retain the dragon fight, 1 whether it formed originally a part of the tale or not. Gottfried of Strassburg introduces it thus:-","\"Now, the story tells us that there was at that time in Ireland a monstrous dragon which devoured the people and wasted the land; so that the king at last had sworn a solemn oath that whoever slew the monster should have the Princess Iseult to wife; and because of the beauty of the maiden and the fierceness of the dragon, many a valiant knight had lost his life. The land was full of the tale, and it had come to Tristan's 1 ears, and in the thought of this had he made his journey.","\"The next morning, ere it was light, he rose and armed himself secretly, and took his strongest spear, and mounted his steed, and rode forth into the wilderness. He rode by many a rough path till the sun was high in the heavens, when he turned downwards into a valley, where, as the geste tells us, the dragon had its lair. Then he saw afar off four men galloping swiftly over the moor where there was no road. One of them was the queen's seneschal, who would fain have been the lover of the Princess Iseult, but she liked him not. Whenever knights rode forth bent on adventures, the seneschal was ever with them for nothing on earth save that men might say they had seen him ride forth, for never would he face the dragon, but would return swifter than he went.","\"Now, when Tristan saw the men in flight he knew the dragon must be near at hand, so he rode on steadily, and ere long he saw the monster coming towards him, breathing out smoke and flame from its open jaws. The knight laid his spear in rest, and set spurs to his steed, and rode so swiftly, and smote so strongly, that the spear went in at the open jaws, and pierced through the throat into the dragon's heart, and he himself came with such force against the dragon that his horse fell dead, and he could scarce free himself from the steed. But the evil beast fell upon the corpse and partly devoured it, till the wound from the spear pained it so sorely that it left the horse half-eaten, and fled into a rocky ravine.","\"Tristan followed after the monster, which fled before him, roaring for pain till the rocks rang again with the sound. It cast fire from its jaws and tore up the earth around, till the pain of the wound overcame it, and it crouched down under a wall of rock. Then Tristan drew forth his sword, thinking to slay the monster easily, but ’twas a hard strife, the hardest Tristan had ever fought, and in truth he thought it would be his death. For the dragon had as aids smoke and flame, teeth and claws sharper than a shearing knife; and the knight had much ado to find shelter behind the trees and bushes, for the fight was so fierce that the shield he held in his hand was burnt well-nigh to a coal. But the conflict did not endure over-long, for the spear in the vitals of the dragon began to pain him so that he lay on the ground, rolling over and over in agony. Then Tristan came near swiftly and smote with his sword at the heart of the monster so that the blade went in right to the hilt; and the dragon gave forth a roar so grim and terrible that it was as if heaven and earth fell together, and the cry was heard far and wide through the land. Tristan himself was well-nigh terrified, but as he saw the beast was dead he went near, and with much labour he forced the jaws open, and cut out the tongue; then he closed the jaws again, and put the tongue in his bosom. He turned him again to the wilderness, thinking to rest through the day, and come again to his people secretly in the shadows of the night; but he was so overcome by the stress of the fight and the fiery breath of the dragon that he was well-nigh spent, and seeing a little lake near at hand into which a clear stream flowed from the rock, he went towards it, and as he came to the cool waters the weight of his armour and the venom of the dragon's tongue overpowered him, and he fell senseless by the stream.","\"Iseult and her mother afterwards found Tristan, and drew him out of the water, whereupon the dragon's tongue fell from his breast. And when all the folk came together to know the end of the seneschal's matter, Tristan spake-","\"'Lords all, mark this marvel, I slew the dragon, and cut this tongue from out the jaws, yet this man afterwards smote it a second time to death.'","\"And all the lords said, 'One thing is clear, he who came first and cut out the tongue was the man who slew the monster.' And never a man said nay.\"","Wales, too, has its legends of dragons, serpents, and snakes. It seems to have been an old Welsh belief that all lizards were formerly women. Every Welsh farmhouse had two snakes. They never appeared until just before the death of the master or mistress of the house; then the snakes died.\" Parallel with this, perhaps, is the number of river names within the Celtic area that seem to contain the names of goddesses or nymphs of the stream. Such are met with in Lōchy, the Nigra Dea (black goddess) of Adamnan; in Affric, both a lake and river name, also a personal female name, from aith bhric (root), as in breac (spotted); in Nevis, where Dr MacBain rightly detected some nymph name like Nebestis; Aberdeen, Gaelic Obair-dhea’oin, with a strongly trilled r, showing that dh of old deuona (goddess, etc.) has been assimilated to the preceding word for estuary, deuona itself being a divine name, and exemplifying in a river name what Ausonius tells us was the case with sacred springs in Gaul-fons addite divis (they were dedicated to the gods) . To be included in the number is the name of the river Boyne, which under the form Bofind (white cow) yields Boyne, the name of Fraoch's mother's sister from the Sídh (Shee) or Faëry. The form Boand (genitive Bóinde), also that in the phrase in (h)ostio Boindeo (at the mouth of the Boyne) goes back on some such form as Boouinda (white cow). This recalls an Irish name for the Milky Way-bóthar bó finne (the way or path of the cow of whiteness) . But in Uist I met with the name Sliochd Uis (Milky Way), meaning seemingly \"the path or way of whiteness or brightness,\" the root of which recurs again in Uisne (Uisnech).","But the survey of the theme would not be complete in the form in which the more modern tradition leaves it. I have therefore given the story of Fraoch from the Book of the Dean of Lismore, and also the first part of the old and important tale known as the Táin Bó Fráich, of which the following manuscripts exist: The Book of Leinster; The Yellow Book of Lecan; Edinburgh Advocates’ Library Gaelic MS. XL.; Egerton 1782 (British Museum). This old story has been edited with all the important variants, with his wonted care and skill, by Professor Kuno Meyer in the Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie for 1902. In making my translation I tried to select from among the best of the variant readings. The last seven sections of the Táin Bó Fráich I have not translated here: they are apart from the Geste of Fraoch, and bring the hero of the narrative on further adventures elsewhere. This tale is one of the oldest of our secular narratives in Gadhelic: it belongs to about the ninth century, a period when the Scoto-Celtic idiom of Alba was one with the language of Erin. A translation was made by the late Mr J. O’Beirne Crowe, which appeared in the Royal Irish Academy Proceedings for 1870, but subsequent studies have necessitated many changes.","The name Fraoch (Fraech) is very ancient. It survives in the place name Clonfree (Cluain Fraeich), Strokestown, Roscommon. On an Ogham stone it occurs in Netta Vroicci maqi muccoi Trenaluggo at Donaghmore, Kildare; also in Vraicci maqi Medvi on an Ogham from Rathcroghan, Roscommon. In this last it stands for (the stone) of Fraoch, son of Medb. 1 Another account of the death of Fraoch than that given in what I term the Geste of Fraoch is met with in the Táin Bó Cuailnge, where he meets his death at the hands of Cuchulainn. It is noticeable that his fairy origin is pointed to, and that his death is associated with water. This episode is at a later stage in his story than that in Táin Bó Fráich, which gives the serpent encounter. He had by this time accompanied Mève's forces as recounted in the Cattle-Raid of Cuailnge (Táin Bó Cuailnge), and his healing at the hands of the folk of Fiery is to be presupposed: here again they intervene, and we hear of Fraoch's fairy-mound. Here is the Táin Bó Cuailnge version of the death of Fraoch, or Fraech:-","\"They are there till next morning; then Fraech is summoned to them. 'Help us, O Fraech,' said Medb (Mève). 'Remove from us the strait that is on us. Go before Cuchulainn before us, if perchance you shall fight with him.'","\"He set out early in the morning with nine men, till he reached Ath Fuait. He saw the warrior bathing in the river.","\"'Wait here,' said Fraech to his retinue, 'till I come to the man yonder; not good is the water,' said he.","\"He took off his clothes, and goes into the water to him.","\"'Do not come to me,' said Cuchulainn. 'You will die from it, and I should be sorry to kill you.'","\"'I shall come indeed,' said Fraech, 'that we may meet in the water; and let your play with me be fair.'","\"'Settle it as you like,' said Cuchulainn.","\"'The hand of each of us round the other,' said Fraech.","\"They set to wrestling for a long time on the water, and Fraech was submerged. Cuchulainn lifted him up again.","\"'This time,' said Cuchulainn, 'will you yield and accept your life?'","\"'I will not suffer it,' said Fraech.","\"Cuchulainn put him under it again, until Fraech was killed. He comes to land; his retinue carry his body to the camp. Ath Fraich, that was the name of that ford for ever. All the host lamented Fraech. They saw a troop of women in green tunics 1 on the body of Fraech mac Idaid; they drew him from them into the mound. Sid Fraich was the name of that mound afterwards.\"","Ailill's plan in compassing the death of Fraoch recalls his episode with Fergus, son of Rōg. Keating 2 tells how, when Fergus was in banishment in Connaught, it happened that he was with Ailill and Mève in Magh Ai, where they had a fortress; and one day, when they went out to the shore of a lake that was near the lios (or outer court), Ailill asked Fergus to go and swim in the lake, and Fergus did so. While swimming, Mève was seized by a desire of swimming with him; and when she had gone into the lake with Fergus, Ailill grew jealous, and he ordered a kinsman of his to cast a spear at Fergus, which pierced him through the breast; and Fergus came ashore on account of the wound caused by that cast, and extracted the spear from his body and cast it in the direction of Ailill; and it pierced a gray hound that was near his chariot, and thereupon Fergus fell and died and was buried on the shore of the same lake.","Rhys points out that Ailill (written Oilill in Keating) seems cognate with Welsh ellyll (an elf or demon), and that Mève's Ailill belongs to a race which is always ranged against the Tuatha Dé Danann. Mève he associates with the goddesses of dawn and dusk, who are found at one time consorting with bright beings and at another with dark ones, and they commonly associate themselves with water. Curious too that Mève's sisters Eithne and Clothru are associated the one with the river Inny (Eithne) in Westmeath, the other with Clothru's Isle (Inis Clothraun) in Loch Ree.","Eochaidh Feidhlioch, monarch at Tara, was Mève's father. He had three sons and three daughters-namely, Breas and Nar and Lothar, the three sons; Eithne Uathach, Clothra, and Mève of Cruachan, the three daughters, as the poet says in this quatrain:-","\"Three daughters had Eochaidh Feidhlioch,","Fame on a lofty seat:","Eithne Uathach, fair Mève of Cruachan,","And Clothra.","O’Curry remarks of Mève that she seemed more calculated to govern many men than to be governed by one man. She soon abandoned Conchobar, and returned to her father, the monarch Eochaidh Feidhlioch, to Tara, who shortly after set her up as the independent queen of the province of Connaught. Through jealousy and hatred, fierce war raged between her and her former husband, Conchobar, who finally was killed by a Connaught champion, Cét Mac Magach. This Conchobar, King of Ultonia, is spoken of as being a terrestrial god among the Ultonians. His mother's name was Ness, hence he is known as Mac Nessa. This goddess name is connected with that in Loch Ness, and points to her as having been conceived of at first as a water-nymph. This does not prejudice what reflex of historic movements these stories may imply. Curiously, the death of Mève, no less than that of Fraoch, is associated with water. Keating's 2 account is as follows:-","\"When Olill had been slain by Conall Cearnach, Mève went to Inis Clothrann, on Lough Ribh (Ree), to live; and while she resided there, she was under an obligation (ba geis di, i.e. under a taboo or gessa) to bathe every morning in the well which was at the entrance to the island. And when Forbuidhe, son of Conchobar (her former husband) heard this, he visited the well one day alone, and with a line measured from the brink of the well to the other side of the lake, and took the measure with him to Ulster, and practised thus: he inserted two poles in the ground, and tied an end of the line to each pole, and placed an apple on one of the poles, and stood himself at the other pole, and kept constantly firing from his sling at the apple that was on the top of the pole till he struck it. This exercise he practised until he had grown so dexterous that he would miss no aim at the apple. Soon after this there was a meeting of the people of Ulster and Connaught at both sides of the Shannon at Inis Clothrann; and Forbuidhe came there from the east with the Ulster gathering. And one morning, while he was there, he saw Mève bathing, as was her wont, in the fore-mentioned well; and with that he fixed a stone in his sling and hurled it at her, and struck her in the forehead, so that she died on the spot, having been ninety-eight years on the throne of Connaught, as we have said above.\"","Of Fraoch's mother Boand, elsewhere spoken of as from the Sídhe, the Bodleian Dindshenchus gives the following account: 2-","\"Bóann, wife of Nechtán, son of Labraid, son of Nama, went with the cupbearers to the well-of-the-green of the fortress. Whoever went alone to it came not from it without disgrace. Now these were the names of the cupbearers whom Nechtán had, even Flesc and Lesc and Luam. Unless the cupbearers went to the well, no human being would come from it without disgrace.","\"Then, with pride and haughtiness, the queen went alone to the well, and said that it had no secret or power unless it could disgrace her shape. And she went round the well withershins thrice, to perceive the well's magic power. Out of the well three waves break over her, and suddenly her right thigh and her right hand and her right eye burst, and then she fled out of the fairy mound, fleeing the disgrace and fleeing the well, so that she reached the sea with the water of the well behind her. And the Inber Bóinne (river-mouth of Boyne) drowned her. Hence 'Bóann' and 'Inber Bóinne.'\"","\"One day Boyne of the mark of Bregia","Broke every fence as far as the White Sea;","Bóann was the name on that day","Of the wife of Nechtán, son of Labraid.\"","Nechtán, the mythic owner of the fairy precinct now called Trinity Well, into which one could not gaze with impunity, and from which the river Boyne first burst forth in pursuit of the lady who insulted it, may be cognate, Rhys thought, with Neptune, which certainly seems cognate with Irish Nuada Necht.","How rivers came to be personified may be illustrated by an enigma which a poet puts to Finn in the tale of the Fairy-Palace of the Quicken Trees: 2-","\"I saw to the south a bright-faced queen","With couch of crystal and robe of green;","A numerous offspring sprightly and small,","Plain through her skin you can see them all;","Slowly she moves, and yet her speed","Exceeds the pace of the swiftest steed!","Now tell me the name of that wondrous queen,","With her couch of crystal and robe of green.\"","To this Finn answers: \"The queen you saw is the river Boyne, which flows by the south side of the palace of Bruga. Her couch of crystal is the sandy bed of the river; and her robe of green the grassy plain of Bregia, through which it flows. Her children, which you can see through her skin, are the speckled salmon, the lively pretty trout, and all the other fish that swim in the clear water of the river. The river flows slowly indeed; but its waters traverse the whole world in seven years, which is more than the swiftest steed can do.\"","A booklet entitled The Death of Fraoch, a Gaelic poem, was printed at Iona in 1887, by J. MacCormick and W. Muir, and published there by F. Ritchie. In 1888 a copy of the same appeared at Iona, with illustrations by W. C. Ward. For a perusal, after my own rendering was finished, of these now rare editions I have to thank Mrs MacMillan, the Manse, Iona. The Preface is of special interest, as telling that the events narrated \"occurred in Mull, in the district surrounding Loch Laich.... The local tradition is that Fraoch lived at Suidhe, near the village of Bunessan. Opposite him, in an oblique direction on the other side of the loch, lived Mev, through whose treachery Fraoch was slain; the place is still known as larach tigh Meidhe. The island where the rowan tree grew is called after her, Eilean Mhain 1 (the isle of Main). It is right opposite to Bunessan.","\"The local tradition asserts that the monster which guarded the rowan tree, and by which Fraoch was slain, was a great serpent; but we take leave to doubt this, because great serpents were not known in Scotland. We think that the creature was the torc nimhe (wild boar), which undoubtedly was common in the Highlands. Some who possess the tradition say that Fraoch was found dead with the heart of the beast in his hand, on the strand of the 'Bay of the heart' (Camus A’ Chridhe). The bay is there to witness this, but we do not read in the poem that the monster's heart was really torn out.\" The writers take exception to translating Cruachan in the third verse by Ben Cruachan, Loch Awe, and simply render cruachan soir \"the hill in the east.\" They hope this rendering \"effectually\" dissipates \"that myth\"-i.e., of associating the scene with Loch Awe. They have no recollection of the celebrated Cruachan in Roscommon. Fraoch they associate with energy: \"Fraoch is seen to be an appropriate name for an eager, impetuous, generous, affectionate, strong, young man.\" The writers add that the strength of Fraoch is still proverbial. It is common yet to say nam bithinn-sa cho làidir ri Fraoch spionainn craobh as a bun-i.e., \"were I as strong as Fraoch, I could pull a tree from its roots.\"","A tune is added \"as it was sung in Mull fifty years ago,\" on the authority of Mr Neil MacCormick of Fionn-phort-the first verse being repeated after each of the others, as a chorus. \"It has the strain of a lament, and the tune to which it is sung is most melodious and melancholy.\" The air there noted is different to that given in the Appendix to Dr K. N. Macdonald's Gesto Collection. In Scotland the legend is also localised at Loch Freuchie, near Amulree, Perthshire; and at Loch Awe, Argyll, where the legend has been moralised in poetic treatment at the hands of Mr P. G. Hamerton in his Isles of Loch Awe (1855). Mr Hamerton compares the Celtic Myth to that of Hercules: he depicts both Fraoch and the lady as dying after the tasting of the poisonous fruit:","\"Both their faces were in deepest shade","Close to each other. Thus the pair were found.\"","Mr Hamerton draws a moral:","\"There are fables full of truth","Fraoch's tale is sadly true!","For how many in their youth,","Bitten by the serpent's tooth,","Die or only live to rue!\"","A free rendering of the eighteenth-century Lay of Fraoch, which really does not belong to the Ossianic Cycle, was given by Jerome Stone, (1727-1756) in the Scots Magazine, with a letter dated Dunkeld, Nov. 15, 1755. He made an unwarrantable change in heading the poem Sir Albin and the Daughter of Mey.","In Hamerton the fruit is poisonous: Fraoch and the \"Lady of Loch Awe\" both die of it. The eating of the fruit of the Tree of Life brings death. Medb could not live without the fruit; Fraoch could not taste of it, or even go through the perils of getting it, without dying. Fraoch must not go near the water; otherwise there will be a conflict which will issue in his death. Boand (Boyne), his mother's sister, cautions Fraoch's mother against the water, according to a poem in the Book of Fermoy-","\"Let him not swim Black Water,","For therein he shall shed his blood.\"","According to the Highland Lays, Fraoch dies by the serpent, and Findabair laments him. In the Táin Bó Fraich there is only a promised betrothal with Findabair. According to the Book of Fermoy, his wife is Treblann, a foster-child to Coirpre mac Rossa, who belonged to Faëry. In the Táin Bó Fráich his healing came from the Sídhe, and he survived to take part with Medb on the foray of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, when he fell at the hands of Cuchulainn. In either case his death is connected with water. Medb was previously wife of Conchobar, who, according to a gloss in the Book of the Dun Cow, was formerly a god upon earth (día talmanda). In another account we find Conchobar as the name of a river. 1 Medb's first husband would thus seem to have been a water-god. One might hazard the suggestion that in old Druidic teaching, Medb herself may have been a sort of sea-mother, if indeed their thought on ultimate things may have got the length of postulating a mother of mankind. The berries for which she craved were from the Tree of Life, the food of the gods, the eating of which by mortals brings death. Rowan hurdles were used in Druidic divination: 1 the rowan was a magic medicine; a monster was thought to haunt the roots of a rowan, and typified the guardian spirit of the tree. The thought is old among the Celts; on the second altar of Notre Dame there is a figure of the Celtic Hercules killing a serpent, 2 which the late Monsieur D’Arbois de Jubainville tried to explain by episodes from Gadhelic myth. The dragon may be thought of as the confiner that holds captive the fruit-bearing Tree of Life. On this view he may be the winter-monster which Hildebrandt sees in the Indian Vritra, the \"confiner\" that holds captive the rivers, while Indra is the spring or summer sun which frees them from the clutches of the winter dragon. The rage of the sun-god may be conceived of as manifested against the cloud-dragon, or the winter-dragon, or the sea-dragon. Fraoch may thus be the Celtic Hercules Furens, the name being the same in root as fraoch (wrath), early Irish fraech (fury, rage), which is cognate with Cymric gwrug. 3 His quest may be a solar journey; and he is swallowed by the monster as the sun is swallowed by the sea. On this view the dragon myth should portray the hero as being devoured by a fish, as on Semitic ground, for which the reader should consult the great Bible Dictionaries, which treat of Bel and the Dragon and allied themes. In Fraoch the hero is slain, which is parallel to his being swallowed by the sea; if not cast up again, he is healed at the hands of the Sídhe. May we not infer that the myth is an endeavour to shadow forth some aspects of the external world, a picture, not yet moralised, of the cosmic process, an eternal tragedy of nature?","So far as Fraoch's conflict is comparable with that of Herakles and the Hydra, I should like to emphasise a trait in Euripides (Ion, v. 192) where Herakles kills the hydra with golden sickles: Λερναῖον ὕδαν ἐναιρει χρυσέαις ἅρπαις ὁ Διὸς παῖς. On an Attic vase there is depicted the conflict of Herakles against the Centaur Nessos, in reality, a river-god. Perhaps if we had the Celtic Myth in its earliest stage we should find Medb herself to have been a sort of serpent or water-monster.","The idea of a paradise or elysium among the Celts, as with the Greeks, assumes two aspects-either that of the hollow-hill (sídhe), that is, the fairy-mound, or that of the over-sea elysium. This contrast may have some relation to the civilisation and home of the Celts; the former pointing, as to its origin, to their continental home, the latter to their insular and maritime abode. The berries of the rowan tree are the berries of the gods, and as connected with the other world are parallel to the idea attached to Emain Ablach, Emain rich in apples, which, from the Book of Fermoy and from the Voyage of Bran, Professor Kuno Meyer has pointed out is connected with the Isle of the Blessed, and parallel to the idea attached to the Vale of Avalion (Avalon), where \"falls not hail, nor rain, nor any snow.\" Underlying the whole is the idea of the Island of the Blessed, insula promorum quae fortuna vocatur. As to Fraoch's exploit, in so far as it may be parallel to that of Herakles, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, in his Commentary on the Herakles of Euripides, has pointed out that the garden of the gods, with the tree which carries the apples of life, is really quite independent of the Herakles saga, while a highly archaic variant of that story is that Herakles leaps into the jaws of a sea-monster, the jaws of death. On Celtic ground, too, we have the contest of a hero with a water-monster quite apart from Fraoch, and the rowan tree guarded by the dragon. The continuation of the Táin Bó Fráich brings the hero across the sea to the Alps and to the Langobardi. Here Fraoch is represented as being of the Ultonians: after high exploits he and his friends came to the territory of the Cruithen-tuath, the Pictish people, and later on he joined Ailill and Medb on the Táin Bó Cuailnge. It is impossible to be sure whether we have not here a hint that Fraoch was a hero of the Picts, the people whom the Gael called Cruithne (Cruithen-tuath), a word cognate in root with Cymric pryd in Ynys Prydain, and pointing to the pre-Gadhelic population of these isles as a people who practised tatooing.","Apart from the accessory of the Tree of Life, the parallel that is closest of all is the rescue of Andromeda by Perseus. On a hydria in the Berlin Museum there is a representation of Perseus in conflict with the monster fish, where there is present Andromeda, Kepheus, and another woman (Jope?). The whole story of the Geste of Fraoch is there minus the rowan tree and the serpent, which is replaced by the monster fish. Among the Greeks it formed the subject of a lost drama of Euripides, but we know the theme from the pseudo-Apollodorus. Perseus, on having come to Æthiopia, the kingdom of Kepheus, found the king's daughter Andromeda about to be exposed to a sea-monster. Kassiepeia, the wife of Kepheus, had boasted of her beauty, and thus fell into strife with the Nereids, or water-nymphs. This brought on her the anger of the Nereids and of Poseidon, who sent a flood and a monster to her father's realm. The oracle of Ammon gave out that the disaster to the kingdom would be averted if the king abandoned his daughter Andromeda to be devoured of the monster. Pressed by the Æthiopians, Kepheus had his daughter bound to a rock; in this state she was found by Perseus, who, smitten with love, promised Kepheus to slay the monster on condition that he would have the king's daughter, on her deliverance, to be his wife. This condition was agreed to, and thereafter Perseus went to meet the monster, killed it, and rescued Andromeda. This is another version of the Herakles-Hesione saga, which briefly is as follows. Poseidon and Apollo came in human form to Laomedon, King of Troy, and promised, for a certain reward, to gird his city with walls. The king would not fulfil his promise when the work was ended; whereupon Apollo sent a pest, and Poseidon a sea-monster which used to carry off the people working on the fields. Laomedon sought the advice of an oracle, which counselled him, in penance for his guilt, to deliver his daughter Hesione to the monster. In consequence of this divine judgment, Hesione was chained to a rock. As Herakles came the way he offered to free the maiden if Laomedon would give him the horses which he formerly received from Zeus on account of Ganymede. Which being agreed to, Herakles slew the monster and freed the maid. But the stubborn king endeavoured to deceive Herakles also, which drew upon him the vengeance whereby Troy is said to have been first of all destroyed.","It is at Joppa, in Phoenicia, that the story of Andromeda has been localised of old. Pliny 1 tells us that the Phoenician Joppa is older than the flood, that it lies on a hill, in front of which is a rock where traces of the fetters of Andromeda are pointed out. And St Jerome, in his Commentary on Jonah, writes: \"Here (at Joppa) is the place where on the strand are pointed out to this day the rocks to which Andromeda was bound, and from which she is said to have been freed by the help of Perseus. And on an Attic vase is a representation of Jason being vomited from out of the belly of a sea-monster or dragon at the command of Athene.\"","While we have no reference as to Fraoch having been swallowed by the dragon, the fisher's first son was swallowed by the mermaid, who is induced from her love of music to cast him forth once more. 1 It is also noticeable that the impostor incident, so common in the dragon stories, alongside of the rescuer, is lacking in Fraoch. But the impostor incident must have been known of old among the Celts, for we find it alluded to in the Rescue of Derforgaill, or Dervorgoil, a variant of a folk-tale introduced into the \"Wooing of Emer,\" a text of the Cuchulainn Cycle. On coming to the dwelling of Ruad, King of the Isles, at Hallowe’en, Cuchulainn hears wailing in the fort. The king's daughter Derforgaill has been assigned in tribute to the Fomori, and she is exposed on the seashore, awaiting their coming. Cuchulainn kills three Fomori (or sea-giants) in single combat, but his last opponent wounds him at the wrist. The girl gives a strip from her raiment to bind his wound, and her rescuer goes off without making himself known. \"The maiden came to the dūn and told her father the whole story... . Many in the dūn boasted of having killed the Fomori, but the maiden did nor believe them.\" On a test having been applied, the maiden recognised Cuchulainn, it is to be inferred, from the piece from off her raiment on his wound.","In Brittany the impostor figures as a charcoal-burner, who professes to have killed the seven-headed serpent to which the king's daughter was to have been sacrificed, and he carries off the heads. But the herd had cut out the seven tongues, and these are tokens of the true victor.","In Highland folk-tales the rescuer appears in the character of herd, 2 and the impostor as a squint-eyed, 3 carroty-headed cook. Its parallel in Ireland is The Thirteenth Son of the King of Erin 4; here the hero also hires himself as cow-herd, and rescues a king's daughter from an úr-feíst, a great serpent of the sea, a monster which must get a king's daughter to devour every seven years. While he slept in the maiden's lap, she took three hairs from his head and hid them in her bosom. He has three conflicts with the monster, and each time he is victor. On the third trial the hero Sean Ruadh takes a brown apple, given him by a giant's housekeeper, and threw it into the monster's mouth, \"and the beast fell helpless on the strand, flattened out, and melted away to a dirty jelly on the shore.\" The girl was able to identify her rescuer by one of his blue-glass boots. The hero finally put the claimants to death, and wedded the maid.","This story has been identified in Brittany and among the Basques. Mr E. Sidney Hartland says: \"The indications point to a Celtic or Iberian population as the originators of the Herdsman type 1 ... a highly specialised type, differing considerably from any form of the classical story, and peculiar to the West of Europe. We have no direct evidence as to the date when the stories of the Herdsman type arose; but it will be recollected that there is reason to think the type belongs to the Celto-Iberian race, and therefore is of prehistoric age. Nor will the reader fail to note that the Rescue of Derforgaill (Dervorgoil, Dervorgilla) from the Fomori appears to be an offshoot of the same type that it is found among one of the branches of the same Celto-Iberian race, and that it is one of the oldest -nay, perhaps the oldest-post-classical variant in Europe of the Perseus group. All these considerations make for its independence of the classical tale; and their cumulative weight may fairly be called decisive.\" 2","On this account alone the old story is worthy of a place in our esteem. It conduces to thought, if not to thoughtfulness. Whatever its full origin may be, I suggest that human sense-perception conjoined with racial memories of contest with the raw environment of Nature, and the memory of human ills entailed upon our race by monsters of the prime, 1 along with human phantasy and imagination acting upon the reports of sense, ought to be allowed their due claims to account for some moments of the tale. But folk-tales have a compound-complex origin. I am not in favour of needlessly multiplying hypotheses. Some moments may be due to other races. Nor ought we to close our eyes to the background of the heavens. If the berries from the rowan tree have aught in common with the golden apples of the Hesperides, fetched by Herakles, it is proper to recollect that worthy scholars read herein the remains of a saga connected with the moon. Siecke 2 explains that, according to some ancients, Herakles himself plucked the apples after he had slain the snake that guarded the tree; that he fetched the golden apple or the three apples from the extreme West, as was the case with the bull and the girdle of the Amazons. He holds that these are the expression of indubitable perceptions. \"Who has not seen, where the sun declines, the golden horns of the bull, the golden girdle, the apple of gold?\" says Siecke. All of them for a while had vanished, but Herakles brings them back; truly not forever; Athene or some other divinity will bring them to their place, and into the power of the dragon, for the World Order cannot be altered. Yet the hero kills the dragon anew, and fetches the golden apples once more. And so, I would add, with Fraoch.","There are dragons still to be slain. May the recital of an old tale kindle the mind to new adventures. Here are materials for poets and painters. It is we who are living now. Let us mould them to express ourselves. The ancients have expressed themselves through similar tales; nor will we fulfil ourselves by entirely disregarding our ancestral past and our wealth of complex tradition.","Let me express my heartfelt thanks to Miss Rachel Ainslie Grant Duff, Delgaty Castle, for the kindness which prompted her to make beautiful illustrations for this book. It helps to make it so much more human, and has given me indefinable pleasure, which will communicate itself to other artists. And if anyone should paint Medb, let them remember an early description in the Táin: a beautiful, pale, long-faced woman, with long flowing golden-yellow hair, having a crimson cloak fastened with a brooch of gold over her breast, a straight-ridged spear flaming in her hand.","The theme is largely identical with that of St George and the Dragon, which meets us in the Golden Legend of Jacques de Voragine, and appears in the office books of the Church in the Middle Ages:-","\"O Georgi Martyr inclyte","Te decet laus et gloria","Predolatum militia","Per quem puella regia","Existens in tristitia","Coram Dracone pessimo","Salvata est!\""],"labels":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}

To read himself to sleep. An oil lamp on a chair near his elbow burns unsteadily. The cabin room is spaced fantastically about it. Whitewashed hearth and chimney, black with sooty saw-teeth. Ceiling, patterned by the fringed globe of the lamp. The walls, unpainted, are seasoned a rosin yellow. And cracks between the boards are black. These cracks are the lips the night winds use for whispering. Night winds in Georgia are vagrant poets, whispering. Kabnis, against his will, lets his book slip down, and listens to them. The warm whiteness of his bed, the lamp-light, do not protect him from the weird chill of their song:","White-man’s land.","Niggers, sing.","Burn, bear black children","Till poor rivers bring","Rest, and sweet glory","In Camp Ground.","Kabnis’ thin hair is streaked on the pillow. His hand strokes the slim silk of his mustache. His thumb, pressed under his chin, seems to be trying to give squareness and projection to it. Brown eyes stare from a lemon face. Moisture gathers beneath his arm-pits. He slides down beneath the cover, seeking release.","Kabnis: Near me. Now. Whoever you are, my warm glowing sweetheart, do not think that the face that rests beside you is the real Kabnis. Ralph Kabnis is a dream. And dreams are faces with large eyes and weak chins and broad brows that get smashed by the fists of square faces. The body of the world is bull-necked. A dream is a soft face that fits uncertainly upon it... God, if I could develop that in words. Give what I know a bull-neck and a heaving body, all would go well with me, wouldnt it, sweetheart? If I could feel that I came to the South to face it. If I, the dream (not what is weak and afraid in me) could become the face of the South. How my lips would sing for it, my songs being the lips of its soul. Soul. Soul hell. There aint no such thing. What in hell was that?","A rat had run across the thin boards of the ceiling. Kabnis thrusts his head out from the covers. Through the cracks, a powdery faded red dust sprays down on him. Dust of slave-fields, dried, scattered... No use to read. Christ, if he only could drink himself to sleep. Something as sure as fate was going to happen. He couldnt stand this thing much longer. A hen, perched on a shelf in the adjoining room begins to tread. Her nails scrape the soft wood. Her feathers ruffle.","“Get out of that, you egg-laying bitch.”","Kabnis hurls a slipper against the wall. The hen flies from her perch and cackles as if a skunk were after her.","“Now cut out that racket or I’ll wring your neck for you.”","Answering cackles arise in the chicken yard.","“Why in Christ’s hell cant you leave me alone? Damn it, I wish your cackle would choke you. Choke every mother’s son of them in this God-forsaken hole. Go away. By God I’ll wring your neck for you if you dont. Hell of a mess I’ve got in: even the poultry is hostile. Go way. Go way. By God, I’ll...”","Kabnis jumps from his bed. His eyes are wild. He makes for the door. Bursts through it. The hen, driving blindly at the window-pane, screams. Then flies and flops around trying to elude him. Kabnis catches her.","“Got you now, you she-bitch.”","With his fingers about her neck, he thrusts open the outside door and steps out into the serene loveliness of Georgian autumn moonlight. Some distance off, down in the valley, a band of pine-smoke, silvered gauze, drifts steadily. The half-moon is a white child that sleeps upon the tree-tops of the forest. White winds croon its sleep-song:","rock a-by baby..","Black mother sways, holding a white child on her bosom.","when the bough bends..","Her breath hums through pine-cones.","cradle will fall..","Teat moon-children at your breasts,","down will come baby..","Black mother.","Kabnis whirls the chicken by its neck, and throws the head away. Picks up the hopping body, warm, sticky, and hides it in a clump of bushes. He wipes blood from his hands onto the coarse scant grass.","Kabnis: Thats done. Old Chromo in the big house there will wonder whats become of her pet hen. Well, it’ll teach her a lesson: not to make a hen-coop of my quarters. Quarters. Hell of a fine quarters, I’ve got. Five years ago; look at me now. Earth’s child. The earth my mother. God is a profligate red-nosed man about town. Bastardy; me. A bastard son has got a right to curse his maker. God...","Kabnis is about to shake his fists heaven-ward. He looks up, and the night’s beauty strikes him dumb. He falls to his knees. Sharp stones cut through his thin pajamas. The shock sends a shiver over him. He quivers. Tears mist his eyes. He writhes.","“God Almighty, dear God, dear Jesus, do not torture me with beauty. Take it away. Give me an ugly world. Ha, ugly. Stinking like unwashed niggers. Dear Jesus, do not chain me to myself and set these hills and valleys, heaving with folk-songs, so close to me that I cannot reach them. There is a radiant beauty in the night that touches and ... tortures me. Ugh. Hell. Get up, you damn fool. Look around. Whats beautiful there? Hog pens and chicken yards. Dirty red mud. Stinking outhouse. Whats beauty anyway but ugliness if it hurts you? God, he doesnt exist, but nevertheless He is ugly. Hence, what comes from Him is ugly. Lynchers and business men, and that cockroach Hanby, especially. How come that he gets to be principal of a school? Of the school I’m driven to teach in? God’s handiwork, doubtless. God and Hanby, they belong together. Two godam moral-spouters. Oh, no, I wont let that emotion come up in me. Stay down. Stay down, I tell you. O Jesus, Thou art beautiful... Come, Ralph, pull yourself together. Curses and adoration dont come from what is sane. This loneliness, dumbness, awful, intangible oppression is enough to drive a man insane. Miles from nowhere. A speck on a Georgia hillside. Jesus, can you imagine it-an atom of dust in agony on a hillside? Thats a spectacle for you. Come, Ralph, old man, pull yourself together.”","Kabnis has stiffened. He is conscious now of the night wind, and of how it chills him. He rises. He totters as a man would who for the first time uses artificial limbs. As a completely artificial man would. The large frame house, squatting on brick pillars, where the principal of the school, his wife, and the boarding girls sleep, seems a curious shadow of his mind. He tries, but cannot convince himself of its reality. His gaze drifts down into the vale, across the swamp, up over the solid dusk bank of pines, and rests, bewildered-like, on the court-house tower. It is dull silver in the moonlight. White child that sleeps upon the top of pines. Kabnis’ mind clears. He sees himself yanked beneath that tower. He sees white minds, with indolent assumption, juggle justice and a nigger... Somewhere, far off in the straight line of his sight, is Augusta. Christ, how cut off from everything he is. And hours, hours north, why not say a lifetime north? Washington sleeps. Its still, peaceful streets, how desirable they are. Its people whom he had always halfway despised. New York? Impossible. It was a fiction. He had dreamed it. An impotent nostalgia grips him. It becomes intolerable. He forces himself to narrow to a cabin silhouetted on a knoll about a mile away. Peace. Negroes within it are content. They farm. They sing. They love. They sleep. Kabnis wonders if perhaps they can feel him. If perhaps he gives them bad dreams. Things are so immediate in Georgia.","Thinking that now he can go to sleep, he re-enters his room. He builds a fire in the open hearth. The room dances to the tongues of flames, and sings to the crackling and spurting of the logs. Wind comes up between the floor boards, through the black cracks of the walls.","Kabnis: Cant sleep. Light a cigarette. If that old bastard comes over here and smells smoke, I’m done for. Hell of a note, cant even smoke. The stillness of it: where they burn and hang men, you cant smoke. Cant take a swig of licker. What do they think this is, anyway, some sort of temperance school? How did I ever land in such a hole? Ugh. One might just as well be in his grave. Still as a grave. Jesus, how still everything is. Does the world know how still it is? People make noise. They are afraid of silence. Of what lives, and God, of what dies in silence. There must be many dead things moving in silence. They come here to touch me. I swear I feel their fingers... Come, Ralph, pull yourself together. What in hell was that? Only the rustle of leaves, I guess. You know, Ralph, old man, it wouldnt surprise me at all to see a ghost. People dont think there are such things. They rationalize their fear, and call their cowardice science. Fine bunch, they are. Damit, that was a noise. And not the wind either. A chicken maybe. Hell, chickens dont wander around this time of night. What in hell is it?","A scraping sound, like a piece of wood dragging over the ground, is coming near.","“Ha, ha. The ghosts down this way havent got any chains to rattle, so they drag trees along with them. Thats a good one. But no joke, something is outside this house, as sure as hell. Whatever it is, it can get a good look at me and I cant see it. Jesus Christ!”","Kabnis pours water on the flames and blows his lamp out. He picks up a poker and stealthily approaches the outside door. Swings it open, and lurches into the night. A calf, carrying a yoke of wood, bolts away from him and scampers down the road.","“Well, I’m damned. This godam place is sure getting the best of me. Come, Ralph, old man, pull yourself together. Nights cant last forever. Thank God for that. Its Sunday already. First time in my life I’ve ever wanted Sunday to come. Hell of a day. And down here there’s no such thing as ducking church. Well, I’ll see Halsey and Layman, and get a good square meal. Thats something. And Halsey’s a damn good feller. Cant talk to him, though. Who in Christ’s world can I talk to? A hen. God. Myself... I’m going bats, no doubt of that. Come now, Ralph, go in and make yourself go to sleep. Come now .. in the door .. thats right. Put the poker down. There. All right. Slip under the sheets. Close your eyes. Think nothing .. a long time .. nothing, nothing. Dont even think nothing. Blank. Not even blank. Count. No, mustnt count Nothing .. blank .. nothing .. blank .. space without stars in it. No, nothing .. nothing..","Kabnis sleeps. The winds, like soft-voiced vagrant poets sing:","White-man’s land.","Niggers, sing.","Burn, bear black children","Till poor rivers bring","Rest, and sweet glory","In Camp Ground.","2","The parlor of Fred Halsey’s home. There is a seediness about it. It seems as though the fittings have given a frugal service to at least seven generations of middle-class shop-owners. An open grate burns cheerily in contrast to the gray cold changed autumn weather. An old-fashioned mantelpiece supports a family clock (not running), a figure or two in imitation bronze, and two small group pictures. Directly above it, in a heavy oak frame, the portrait of a bearded man. Black hair, thick and curly, intensifies the pallor of the high forehead. The eyes are daring. The nose, sharp and regular. The poise suggests a tendency to adventure checked by the necessities of absolute command. The portrait is that of an English gentleman who has retained much of his culture, in that money has enabled him to escape being drawn through a land-grubbing pioneer life. His nature and features, modified by marriage and circumstances, have been transmitted to his great-grandson, Fred. To the left of this picture, spaced on the wall, is a smaller portrait of the great-grandmother. That here there is a Negro strain, no one would doubt. But it is difficult to say in precisely what feature it lies. On close inspection, her mouth is seen to be wistfully twisted. The expression of her face seems to shift before one’s gaze-now ugly, repulsive; now sad, and somehow beautiful in its pain. A tin wood-box rests on the floor below. To the right of the great-grandfather’s portrait hangs a family group: the father, mother, two brothers, and one sister of Fred. It includes himself some thirty years ago when his face was an olive white, and his hair luxuriant and dark and wavy. The father is a rich brown. The mother, practically white. Of the children, the girl, quite young, is like Fred; the two brothers, darker. The walls of the room are plastered and painted green. An old upright piano is tucked into the corner near the window. The window looks out169 on a forlorn, box-like, whitewashed frame church. Negroes are gathering, on foot, driving questionable gray and brown mules, and in an occasional Ford, for afternoon service. Beyond, Georgia hills roll off into the distance, their dreary aspect heightened by the gray spots of unpainted one- and two-room shanties. Clumps of pine trees here and there are the dark points the whole landscape is approaching. The church bell tolls. Above its squat tower, a great spiral of buzzards reaches far into the heavens. An ironic comment upon the path that leads into the Christian land... Three rocking chairs are grouped around the grate. Sunday papers scattered on the floor indicate a recent usage. Halsey, a well-built, stocky fellow, hair cropped close, enters the room. His Sunday clothes smell of wood and glue, for it is his habit to potter around his wagon-shop even on the Lord’s day. He is followed by Professor Layman, tall, heavy, loose-jointed Georgia Negro, by turns teacher and preacher, who has traveled in almost every nook and corner of the state and hence knows more than would be good for anyone other than a silent man. Kabnis, trying to170 force through a gathering heaviness, trails in behind them. They slip into chairs before the fire.","Layman: Sholy fine, Mr. Halsey, sholy fine. This town’s right good at feedin folks, better’n most towns in th state, even for preachers, but I ken say this beats um all. Yassur. Now aint that right, Professor Kabnis?","Kabnis: Yes sir, this beats them all, all right-best I’ve had, and thats a fact, though my comparison doesnt carry far, y’know.","Layman: Hows that, Professor?","Kabnis: Well, this is my first time out-","Layman: For a fact. Aint seed you round so much. Whats th trouble? Dont like our folks down this away?","Halsey: Aint that, Layman. He aint like most northern niggers that way. Aint a thing stuck up about him. He likes us, you an me, maybe all-its that red mud over yonder-gets stuck in it an cant get out. (Laughs.) An then he loves th fire so, warm as its been. Coldest Yankee I’ve ever seen. But I’m goin t get him out now in a jiffy, eh, Kabnis?","Kabnis: Sure, I should say so, sure. Dont think its because I dont like folks down this way. Just the opposite, in fact. Theres more hospitality and everything. Its diff-that is, theres lots of northern exaggeration about the South. Its not half the terror they picture it. Things are not half bad, as one could easily figure out for himself without ever crossing the Mason and Dixie line: all these people wouldnt stay down here, especially the rich, the ones that could easily leave, if conditions were so mighty bad. And then too, sometime back, my family were southerners y’know. From Georgia, in fact-","Layman: Nothin t feel proud about, Professor. Neither your folks nor mine.","Halsey (in a mock religious tone): Amen t that, brother Layman. Amen (turning to Kabnis, half playful, yet somehow dead in earnest). An Mr. Kabnis, kindly remember youre in th land of cotton-hell of a land. Th white folks get th boll; th niggers get th stalk. An dont you dare touch th boll, or even look at it. They’ll swing y sho. (Laughs.)","Kabnis: But they wouldnt touch a gentleman-fellows, men like us three here-","Layman: Nigger’s a nigger down this away, Professor. An only two dividins: good an bad. An even they aint permanent categories. They sometimes mixes um up when it comes t lynchin. I’ve seen um do it.","Halsey: Dont let th fear int y, though, Kabnis. This county’s a good un. Aint been a stringin up I can remember. (Laughs.)","Layman: This is a good town an a good county. But theres some that makes up fer it.","Kabnis: Things are better now though since that stir about those peonage cases, arent they?","Layman: Ever hear tell of a single shot killin moren one rabbit, Professor?","Kabnis: No, of course not, that is, but then-","Halsey: Now I know you werent born yesterday, sprung up so rapid like you aint heard of th brick thrown in th hornets’ nest. (Laughs.)","Kabnis: Hardly, hardly, I know-","Halsey: Course y do. (To Layman) See, northern niggers aint as dumb as they make out t be.","Kabnis (overlooking the remark): Just stirs them up to sting.","Halsey: T perfection. An put just like a professor should put it.","Kabnis: Thats what actually did happen?","Layman: Well, if it aint sos only because th stingers already movin jes as fast as they ken go. An been goin ever since I ken remember, an then some mo. Though I dont usually make mention of it.","Halsey: Damn sight better not. Say, Layman, you come from where theyre always swarmin, dont y?","Layman: Yassur. I do that, sho. Dont want t mention it, but its a fact. I’ve seed th time when there werent no use t even stretch out flat upon th ground. Seen um shoot an cut a man t pieces who had died th night befo. Yassur. An they didnt stop when they found out he was dead-jes went on ahackin at him anyway.","Kabnis: What did you do? What did you say to them, Professor?","Layman: Thems th things you neither does a thing or talks about if y want t stay around this away, Professor.","Halsey: Listen t what he’s tellin y, Kabnis. May come in handy some day.","Kabnis: Cant something be done? But of course not. This preacher-ridden race. Pray and shout. Theyre in the preacher’s hands. Thats what it is. And the preacher’s hands are in the white man’s pockets.","Halsey: Present company always excepted.","Kabnis: The Professor knows I wasnt referring to him.","Layman: Preacher’s a preacher anywheres you turn. No use exceptin.","Kabnis: Well, of course, if you look at it that way. I didnt mean- But cant something be done?","Layman: Sho. Yassur. An done first rate an well. Jes like Sam Raymon done it.","Kabnis: Hows that? What did he do?","Layman: Th white folks (reckon I oughtnt tell it) had jes knocked two others like you kill a cow-brained um with an ax, when they caught Sam Raymon by a stream. They was about t do fer him when he up an says, “White folks, I gotter die, I knows that. But wont y let me die in my own way?” Some was fer gettin after him, but th boss held um back an says, “Jes so longs th nigger dies-” An Sam fell down ont his knees an prayed, “O Lord, Ise comin to y,” an he up an jumps int th stream.","Singing from the church becomes audible. Above it, rising and falling in a plaintive moan, a woman’s voice swells to shouting. Kabnis hears it. His face gives way to an expression of mingled fear, contempt, and pity. Layman takes no notice of it. Halsey grins at Kabnis. He feels like having a little sport with him.","Halsey: Lets go t church, eh, Kabnis?","Kabnis (seeking control): All right-no sir, not by a damn sight. Once a days enough for me. Christ, but that stuff gets to me. Meaning no reflection on you, Professor.","Halsey: Course not. Say, Kabnis, noticed y this morning. What’d y get up for an go out?","Kabnis: Couldnt stand the shouting, and thats a fact. We dont have that sort of thing up North. We do, but, that is, some one should see to it that they are stopped or put out when they get so bad the preacher has to stop his sermon for them.","Halsey: Is that th way youall sit on sisters up North?","Kabnis: In the church I used to go to no one ever shouted-","Halsey: Lungs weak?","Kabnis: Hardly, that is-","Halsey: Yankees are right up t th minute in tellin folk how t turn a trick. They always were good at talkin.","Kabnis: Well, anyway, they should be stopped.","Layman: Thats right. Thats true. An its th worst ones in th community that comes int th church t shout. I’ve sort a made a study of it. You take a man what drinks, th biggest licker-head around will come int th church an yell th loudest. An th sister whats done wrong, an is always doin wrong, will sit down in th Amen corner an swing her arms an shout her head off. Seems as if they cant control themselves out in th world; they cant control themselves in church. Now dont that sound logical, Professor?","Halsey: Reckon its as good as any. But I heard that queer cuss over yonder-y know him, dont y, Kabnis? Well, y ought t. He had a run-in with your boss th other day-same as you’ll have if you dont walk th chalk-line. An th quicker th better. I hate that Hanby. Ornery bastard. I’ll mash his mouth in one of these days. Well, as I was sayin, that feller, Lewis’s name, I heard him sayin somethin about a stream whats dammed has got t cut loose somewheres. An that sounds good. I know th feelin myself. He strikes me as knowin a bucketful bout most things, that feller does. Seems like he doesnt want t talk, an does, sometimes, like Layman here. Damn queer feller, him.","Layman: Cant make heads or tails of him, an I’ve seen lots o queer possums in my day. Everybody’s wonderin about him. White folks too. He’ll have t leave here soon, thats sho. Always askin questions. An I aint seed his lips move once. Pokin round an notin somethin. Noted what I said th other day, an that werent fer notin down.","Kabnis: What was that?","Layman: Oh, a lynchin that took place bout a year ago. Th worst I know of round these parts.","Halsey: Bill Burnam?","Layman: Na. Mame Lamkins.","Halsey grunts, but says nothing.","The preacher’s voice rolls from the church in an insistent chanting monotone. At regular intervals it rises to a crescendo note. The sister begins to shout. Her voice, high-pitched and hysterical, is almost perfectly attuned to the nervous key of Kabnis. Halsey notices his distress, and is amused by it. Layman’s face is expressionless. Kabnis wants to hear the story of Mame Lamkins. He does not want to hear it. It can be no worse than the shouting.","Kabnis (his chair rocking faster): What about Mame Lamkins?","Halsey: Tell him, Layman.","The preacher momentarily stops. The choir, together with the entire congregation, sings an old spiritual. The music seems to quiet the shouter. Her heavy breathing has the sound of evening winds that blow through pinecones. Layman’s voice is uniformly low and soothing. A canebrake, murmuring the tale to its neighbor-road would be more passionate.","Layman: White folks know that niggers talk, an they dont mind jes so long as nothing comes of it, so here goes. She was in th family-way, Mame Lamkins was. They killed her in th street, an some white man seein th risin in her stomach as she lay there soppy in her blood like any cow, took an ripped her belly open, an th kid fell out. It was living; but a nigger baby aint supposed t live. So he jabbed his knife in it an stuck it t a tree. An then they all went away.","Kabnis: Christ no! What had she done?","Layman: Tried t hide her husband when they was after him.","A shriek pierces the room. The bronze pieces on the mantel hum. The sister cries frantically: “Jesus, Jesus, I’ve found Jesus. O Lord, glory t God, one mo sinner is acomin home.” At the height of this, a stone, wrapped round with paper, crashes through the window. Kabnis springs to his feet, terror-stricken. Layman is worried. Halsey picks up the stone. Takes off the wrapper, smooths it out, and reads: “You northern nigger, its time fer y t leave. Git along now.” Kabnis knows that the command is meant for him. Fear squeezes him. Caves him in. As a violent external pressure would. Fear flows inside him. It fills him up. He bloats. He saves himself from bursting by dashing wildly from the room. Halsey and Layman stare stupidly at each other. The stone, the crumpled paper are things, huge things that weight them. Their thoughts are vaguely concerned with the texture of the stone, with the color of the paper. Then they remember the words, and begin to shift them about in sentences. Layman even construes them grammatically. Suddenly the sense of them comes back to Halsey. He grips Layman by the arm and they both follow after Kabnis.","A false dusk has come early. The countryside is ashen, chill. Cabins and roads and canebrakes whisper. The church choir, dipping into a long silence, sings:","My Lord, what a mourning,","My Lord, what a mourning,","My Lord, what a mourning,","When the stars begin to fall.","Softly luminous over the hills and valleys, the faint spray of a scattered star...","3","A splotchy figure drives forward along the cane- and corn-stalk hemmed-in road. A scarecrow replica of Kabnis, awkwardly animate. Fantastically plastered with red Georgia mud. It skirts the big house whose windows shine like mellow lanterns in the dusk. Its shoulder jogs against a sweet-gum tree. The figure caroms off against the cabin door, and lunges in. It slams the door as if to prevent some one entering after it.","“God Almighty, theyre here. After me. On me. All along the road I saw their eyes flaring from the cane. Hounds. Shouts. What in God’s name did I run here for? A mud-hole trap. I stumbled on a rope. O God, a rope. Their clammy hands were like the love of death playing up and down my spine. Trying to trip my legs. To trip my spine. Up and down my spine. My spine... My legs... Why in hell didn’t they catch me?”","Kabnis wheels around, half defiant, half numbed with a more immediate fear.","“Wanted to trap me here. Get out o there. I see you.”","He grabs a broom from beside the chimney and violently pokes it under the bed. The broom strikes a tin wash-tub. The noise bewilders. He recovers.","“Not there. In the closet.”","He throws the broom aside and grips the poker. Starts towards the closet door, towards somewhere in the perfect blackness behind the chimney.","“I’ll brain you.”","He stops short. The barks of hounds, evidently in pursuit, reach him. A voice, liquid in distance, yells, “Hi! Hi!”","“O God, theyre after me. Holy Father, Mother of Christ-hell, this aint no time for prayer-”","Voices, just outside the door:","“Reckon he’s here.”","“Dont see no light though.”","The door is flung open.","Kabnis: Get back or I’ll kill you.","He braces himself, brandishing the poker.","Halsey (coming in): Aint as bad as all that. Put that thing down.","Layman: Its only us, Professor. Nobody else after y.","Kabnis: Halsey. Layman. Close that door. Dont light that light. For godsake get away from there.","Halsey: Nobody’s after y, Kabnis, I’m tellin y. Put that thing down an get yourself together.","Kabnis: I tell you they are. I saw them. I heard the hounds.","Halsey: These aint th days of hounds an Uncle Tom’s Cabin, feller. White folks aint in fer all them theatrics these days. Theys more direct than that. If what they wanted was t get y, theyd have just marched right in an took y where y sat. Somebodys down by th branch chasin rabbits an atreein possums.","A shot is heard.","Halsey: Got him, I reckon. Saw Tom goin out with his gun. Tom’s pretty lucky most times.","He goes to the bureau and lights the lamp. The circular fringe is patterned on the ceiling. The moving shadows of the men are huge against the bare wall boards. Halsey walks up to Kabnis, takes the poker from his grip, and without more ado pushes him into a chair before the dark hearth.","Halsey: Youre a mess. Here, Layman. Get some trash an start a fire.","Layman fumbles around, finds some newspapers and old bags, puts them in the hearth, arranges the wood, and kindles the fire. Halsey sets a black iron kettle where it soon will be boiling. Then takes from his hip-pocket a bottle of corn licker which he passes to Kabnis.","Halsey: Here. This’ll straighten y out a bit.","Kabnis nervously draws the cork and gulps the licker down.","Kabnis: Ha. Good stuff. Thanks. Thank y, Halsey.","Halsey: Good stuff! Youre damn right. Hanby there dont think so. Wonder he doesnt come over t find out whos burnin his oil. Miserly bastard, him. Th boys what made this stuff-are y listenin t me, Kabnis? th boys what made this stuff have got th art down like I heard you say youd like t be with words. Eh? Have some, Layman?","Layman: Dont think I care for none, thank y jes th same, Mr. Halsey.","Halsey: Care hell. Course y care. Everybody cares around these parts. Preachers an school teachers an everybody. Here. Here, take it. Dont try that line on me.","Layman limbers up a little, but he cannot quite forget that he is on school ground.","Layman: Thats right. Thats true, sho. Shinin is th only business what pays in these hard times.","He takes a nip, and passes the bottle to Kabnis. Kabnis is in the middle of a long swig when a rap sounds on the door. He almost spills the bottle, but manages to pass it to Halsey just as the door swings open and Hanby enters. He is a well-dressed, smooth, rich, black-skinned Negro who thinks there is no one quite so suave and polished as himself. To members of his own race, he affects the manners of a wealthy white planter. Or, when he is up North, he lets it be known that his ideas are those of the best New England tradition. To white men he bows, without ever completely humbling himself. Tradesmen in the town tolerate him because he spends his money with them. He delivers his words with a full consciousness of his moral superiority.","Hanby: Hum. Erer, Professor Kabnis, to come straight to the point: the progress of the Negro race is jeopardized whenever the personal habits and examples set by its guides and mentors fall below the acknowledged and hard-won standard of its average member. This institution, of which I am the humble president, was founded, and has been maintained at a cost of great labor and untold sacrifice. Its purpose is to teach our youth to live better, cleaner, more noble lives. To prove to the world that the Negro race can be just like any other race. It hopes to attain this aim partly by the salutary examples set by its instructors. I cannot hinder the progress of a race simply to indulge a single member. I have thought the matter out beforehand, I can assure you. Therefore, if I find your resignation on my desk by to-morrow morning, Mr. Kabnis, I shall not feel obliged to call in the sheriff. Otherwise...”","Kabnis: A fellow can take a drink in his own room if he wants to, in the privacy of his own room.","Hanby: His room, but not the institution’s room, Mr. Kabnis.","Kabnis: This is my room while I’m in it.","Hanby: Mr. Clayborn (the sheriff) can inform you as to that.","Kabnis: Oh, well, what do I care-glad to get out of this mud-hole.","Hanby: I should think so from your looks.","Kabnis: You neednt get sarcastic about it.","Hanby: No, that is true. And I neednt wait for your resignation either, Mr. Kabnis.","Kabnis: Oh, you’ll get that all right. Dont worry.","Hanby: And I should like to have the room thoroughly aired and cleaned and ready for your successor by to-morrow noon, Professor.","Kabnis (trying to rise): You can have your godam room right away. I dont want it.","Hanby: But I wont have your cursing.","Halsey pushes Kabnis back into his chair.","Halsey: Sit down, Kabnis, till I wash y.","Hanby (to Halsey): I would rather not have drinking men on the premises, Mr. Halsey. You will oblige me-","Halsey: I’ll oblige you by stayin right on this spot, this spot, get me? till I get damned ready t leave.","He approaches Hanby. Hanby retreats, but manages to hold his dignity.","Halsey: Let me get you told right now, Mr. Samuel Hanby. Now listen t me. I aint no slick an span slave youve hired, an dont y think it for a minute. Youve bullied enough about this town. An besides, wheres that bill youve been owin me? Listen t me. If I dont get it paid in by tmorrer noon, Mr. Hanby (he mockingly assumes Hanby’s tone and manner), I shall feel obliged t call th sheriff. An that sheriff’ll be myself who’ll catch y in th road an pull y out your buggy an rightly attend t y. You heard me. Now leave him alone. I’m takin him home with me. I got it fixed. Before you came in. He’s goin t work with me. Shapin shafts and buildin wagons’ll make a man of him what nobody, y get me? what nobody can take advantage of. Thats all...","Halsey burrs off into vague and incoherent comment.","Pause. Disagreeable.","Layman’s eyes are glazed on the spurting fire.","Kabnis wants to rise and put both Halsey and Hanby in their places. He vaguely knows that he must do this, else the power of direction will completely slip from him to those outside. The conviction is just strong enough to torture him. To bring a feverish, quick-passing flare into his eyes. To mutter words soggy in hot saliva. To jerk his arms upward in futile protest. Halsey, noticing his gestures, thinks it is water that he desires. He brings a glass to him. Kabnis slings it to the floor. Heat of the conviction dies. His arms crumple. His upper lip, his mustache, quiver. Rap! rap, on the door. The sounds slap Kabnis. They bring a hectic color to his cheeks. Like huge cold finger tips they touch his skin and goose-flesh it. Hanby strikes a commanding pose. He moves toward Layman. Layman’s face is innocently immobile.","Halsey: Whos there?","Voice: Lewis.","Halsey: Come in, Lewis. Come on in.","Lewis enters. He is the queer fellow who has been referred to. A tall wiry copper-colored man, thirty perhaps. His mouth and eyes suggest purpose guided by an adequate intelligence. He is what a stronger Kabnis might have been, and in an odd faint way resembles him. As he steps towards the others, he seems to be issuing sharply from a vivid dream. Lewis shakes hands with Halsey. Nods perfunctorily to Hanby, who has stiffened to meet him. Smiles rapidly at Layman, and settles with real interest on Kabnis.","Lewis: Kabnis passed me on the road. Had a piece of business of my own, and couldnt get here any sooner. Thought I might be able to help in some way or other.","Halsey: A good baths bout all he needs now. An somethin t put his mind t rest.","Lewis: I think I can give him that. That note was meant for me. Some Negroes have grown uncomfortable at my being here-","Kabnis: You mean, Mr. Lewis, some colored folks threw it? Christ Amighty!","Halsey: Thats what he means. An just as I told y. White folks more direct than that.","Kabnis: What are they after you for?","Lewis: Its a long story, Kabnis. Too long for now. And it might involve present company. (He laughs pleasantly and gestures vaguely in the direction of Hanby.) Tell you about it later on perhaps.","Kabnis: Youre not going?","Lewis: Not till my month’s up.","Halsey: Hows that?","Lewis: I’m on a sort of contract with myself. (Is about to leave.) Well, glad its nothing serious-","Halsey: Come round t th shop sometime why dont y, Lewis? I’ve asked y enough. I’d like t have a talk with y. I aint as dumb as I look. Kabnis an me’ll be in most any time. Not much work these days. Wish t hell there was. This burg gets to me when there aint. (In answer to Lewis’ question.) He’s goin t work with me. Ya. Night air this side th branch aint good fer him. (Looks at Hanby. Laughs.)","Lewis: I see...","His eyes turn to Kabnis. In the instant of their shifting, a vision of the life they are to meet. Kabnis, a promise of a soil-soaked beauty; uprooted, thinning out. Suspended a few feet above the soil whose touch would resurrect him. Arm’s length removed from him whose will to help... There is a swift intuitive interchange of consciousness. Kabnis has a sudden need to rush into the arms of this man. His eyes call, “Brother.” And then a savage, cynical twist-about within him mocks his impulse and strengthens him to repulse Lewis. His lips curl cruelly. His eyes laugh. They are glittering needles, stitching. With a throbbing ache they draw Lewis to. Lewis brusquely wheels on Hanby.","Lewis: I’d like to see you, sir, a moment, if you dont mind.","Hanby’s tight collar and vest effectively preserve him.","Hanby: Yes, erer, Mr. Lewis. Right away.","Lewis: See you later, Halsey.","Halsey: So long-thanks-sho hope so, Lewis.","As he opens the door and Hanby passes out, a woman, miles down the valley, begins to sing. Her song is a spark that travels swiftly to the near-by cabins. Like purple tallow flames, songs jet up. They spread a ruddy haze over the heavens. The haze swings low. Now the whole countryside is a soft chorus. Lord. O Lord... Lewis closes the door behind him. A flame jets out...","The kettle is boiling. Halsey notices it. He pulls the wash-tub from beneath the bed. He arranges for the bath before the fire.","Halsey: Told y them theatrics didnt fit a white man. Th niggers, just like I told y. An after him. Aint surprisin though. He aint bowed t none of them. Nassur. T nairy a one of them nairy an inch nairy a time. An only mixed when he was good an ready-","Kabnis: That song, Halsey, do you hear it?","Halsey: Thats a man. Hear me, Kabnis? A man-","Kabnis: Jesus, do you hear it.","Halsey: Hear it? Hear what? Course I hear it. Listen t what I’m tellin y. A man, get me? They’ll get him yet if he dont watch out.","Kabnis is jolted into his fear.","Kabnis: Get him? What do you mean? How? Not lynch him?","Halsey: Na. Take a shotgun an shoot his eyes clear out. Well, anyway, it wasnt fer you, just like I told y. You’ll stay over at th house an work with me, eh, boy? Good t get away from his nobs, eh? Damn big stiff though, him. An youre not th first an I can tell y. (Laughs.)","He bustles and fusses about Kabnis as if he were a child. Kabnis submits, wearily. He has no will to resist him.","Layman (his voice is like a deep hollow echo): Thats right. Thats true, sho. Everybody’s been expectin that th bust up was comin. Surprised um all y held on as long as y did. Teachin in th South aint th thing fer y. Nassur. You ought t be way back up North where sometimes I wish I was. But I’ve hung on down this away so long-","Halsey: An there’ll never be no leavin time fer y.","4","A month has passed.","Halsey’s workshop. It is an old building just off the main street of Sempter. The walls to within a few feet of the ground are of an age-worn cement mixture. On the outside they are considerably crumbled and peppered with what looks like musket-shot. Inside, the plaster has fallen away in great chunks, leaving the laths, grayed and cobwebbed, exposed. A sort of loft above the shop proper serves as a break-water for the rain and sunshine which otherwise would have free entry to the main floor. The shop is filled with old wheels and parts of wheels, broken shafts, and wooden litter. A double door, midway the street wall. To the left of this, a work-bench that holds a vise and a variety of wood-work tools. A window with as many panes broken as whole, throws light on the bench. Opposite, in the rear wall, a second window looks out upon the back yard. In the left wall, a rickety smoke-blackened chimney, and hearth with fire blazing. Smooth-worn chairs grouped about the hearth suggest the village meeting-place. Several large wooden blocks, chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the middle of the floor. They are the supports used in almost any sort of wagon-work. Their idleness means that Halsey has no worth-while job on foot. To the right of the central door is a junk heap, and directly behind this, stairs that lead down into the cellar. The cellar is known as “The Hole.” Besides being the home of a very old man, it is used by Halsey on those occasions when he spices up the life of the small town.","Halsey, wonderfully himself in his work overalls, stands in the doorway and gazes up the street, expectantly. Then his eyes grow listless. He slouches against the smooth-rubbed frame. He lights a cigarette. Shifts his position. Braces an arm against the door. Kabnis passes the window and stoops to get in under Halsey’s arm. He is awkward and ludicrous, like a schoolboy in his big brother’s new overalls. He skirts the large blocks on the floor, and drops into a chair before the fire. Halsey saunters towards him.","Kabnis: Time f lunch.","Halsey: Ya.","He stands by the hearth, rocking backward and forward. He stretches his hands out to the fire. He washes them in the warm glow of the flames. They never get cold, but he warms them.","Kabnis: Saw Lewis up th street. Said he’d be down.","Halsey’s eyes brighten. He looks at Kabnis. Turns away. Says nothing. Kabnis fidgets. Twists his thin blue cloth-covered limbs. Pulls closer to the fire till the heat stings his shins. Pushes back. Pokes the burned logs. Puts on several fresh ones. Fidgets. The town bell strikes twelve.","Kabnis: Fix it up f tnight?","Halsey: Leave it t me.","Kabnis: Get Lewis in?","Halsey: Tryin t.","The air is heavy with the smell of pine and resin. Green logs spurt and sizzle. Sap trickles from an old pine-knot into the flames. Layman enters. He carries a lunch-pail. Kabnis, for the moment, thinks that he is a day laborer.","Layman: Evenin, gen’lemun.","Both: Whats say, Layman.","Layman squares a chair to the fire and droops into it. Several town fellows, silent unfathomable men for the most part, saunter in. Overalls. Thick tan shoes. Felt hats marvelously shaped and twisted. One asks Halsey for a cigarette. He gets it. The blacksmith, a tremendous black man, comes in from the forge. Not even a nod from him. He picks up an axle and goes out. Lewis enters. The town men look curiously at him. Suspicion and an open liking contest for possession of their faces. They are uncomfortable. One by one they drift into the street.","Layman: Heard y was leavin, Mr. Lewis.","Kabnis: Months up, eh? Hell of a month I’ve got.","Halsey: Sorry y goin, Lewis. Just getting acquainted like.","Lewis: Sorry myself, Halsey, in a way-","Layman: Gettin t like our town, Mr. Lewis?","Lewis: I’m afraid its on a different basis, Professor.","Halsey: An I’ve yet t hear about that basis. Been waitin long enough, God knows. Seems t me like youd take pity a feller if nothin more.","Kabnis: Somethin that old black cockroach over yonder doesnt like, whatever it is.","Layman: Thats right. Thats right, sho.","Halsey: A feller dropped in here tother day an said he knew what you was about. Said you had queer opinions. Well, I could have told him you was a queer one, myself. But not th way he was driftin. Didnt mean anything by it, but just let drop he thought you was a little wrong up here-crazy, y’know. (Laughs.)","Kabnis: Y mean old Blodson? Hell, he’s bats himself.","Lewis: I remember him. We had a talk. But what he found queer, I think, was not my opinions, but my lack of them. In half an hour he had settled everything: boll weevils, God, the World War. Weevils and wars are the pests that God sends against the sinful. People are too weak to correct themselves: the Redeemer is coming back. Get ready, ye sinners, for the advent of Our Lord. Interesting, eh, Kabnis? but not exactly what we want.","Halsey: Y could have come t me. I’ve sho been after y enough. Most every time I’ve seen y.","Kabnis (sarcastically): Hows it y never came t us professors?","Lewis: I did-to one.","Kabnis: Y mean t say y got somethin from that celluloid-collar-eraser-cleaned old codger over in th mud hole?","Halsey: Rough on th old boy, aint he? (Laughs.)","Lewis: Something, yes. Layman here could have given me quite a deal, but the incentive to his keeping quiet is so much greater than anything I could have offered him to open up, that I crossed him off my mind. And you-","Kabnis: What about me?","Halsey: Tell him, Lewis, for godsake tell him. I’ve told him. But its somethin else he wants so bad I’ve heard him downstairs mumblin with th old man.","Lewis: The old man?","Kabnis: What about me? Come on now, you know so much.","Halsey: Tell him, Lewis. Tell it t him.","Lewis: Life has already told him more than he is capable of knowing. It has given him in excess of what he can receive. I have been offered. Stuff in his stomach curdled, and he vomited me.","Kabnis’ face twitches. His body writhes.","Kabnis: You know a lot, you do. How about Halsey?","Lewis: Yes... Halsey? Fits here. Belongs here. An artist in your way, arent you, Halsey?","Halsey: Reckon I am, Lewis. Give me th work and fair pay an I aint askin nothin better. Went over-seas an saw France; an I come back. Been up North; an I come back. Went t school; but there aint no books whats got th feel t them of them there tools. Nassur. An I’m atellin y.","A shriveled, bony white man passes the window and enters the shop. He carries a broken hatchet-handle and the severed head. He speaks with a flat, drawn voice to Halsey, who comes forward to meet him.","Mr. Ramsay: Can y fix this fer me, Halsey?","Halsey (looking it over): Reckon so, Mr. Ramsay. Here, Kabnis. A little practice fer y.","Halsey directs Kabnis, showing him how to place the handle in the vise, and cut it down. The knife hangs. Kabnis thinks that it must be dull. He jerks it hard. The tool goes deep and shaves too much off. Mr. Ramsay smiles brokenly at him.","Mr. Ramsay (to Halsey): Still breakin in the new hand, eh, Halsey? Seems like a likely enough faller once he gets th hang of it.","He gives a tight laugh at his own good humor. Kabnis burns red. The back of his neck stings him beneath his collar. He feels stifled. Through Ramsay, the whole white South weighs down upon him. The pressure is terrific. He sweats under the arms. Chill beads run down his body. His brows concentrate upon the handle as though his own life was staked upon the perfect shaving of it. He begins to out and out botch the job. Halsey smiles.","Halsey: He’ll make a good un some of these days, Mr. Ramsay.","Mr. Ramsay: Y ought t know. Yer daddy was a good un before y. Runs in th family, seems like t me.","Halsey: Thats right, Mr. Ramsay.","Kabnis is hopeless. Halsey takes the handle from him. With a few deft strokes he shaves it. Fits it. Gives it to Ramsay.","Mr. Ramsay: How much on this?","Halsey: No charge, Mr. Ramsay.","Mr. Ramsay (going out): All right, Halsey. Come down an take it out in trade. Shoe-strings or something.","Halsey: Yassur, Mr. Ramsay.","Halsey rejoins Lewis and Layman. Kabnis, hangdog-fashion, follows him.","Halsey: They like y if y work fer them.","Layman: Thats right, Mr. Halsey. Thats right, sho.","The group is about to resume its talk when Hanby enters. He is all energy, bustle, and business. He goes direct to Kabnis.","Hanby: An axle is out in the buggy which I would like to have shaped into a crow-bar. You will see that it is fixed for me.","Without waiting for an answer, and knowing that Kabnis will follow, he passes out. Kabnis, scowling, silent, trudges after him.","Hanby (from the outside): Have that ready for me by three o’clock, young man. I shall call for it.","Kabnis (under his breath as he comes in): Th hell you say, you old black swamp-gut.","He slings the axle on the floor.","Halsey: Wheeee!","Layman, lunch finished long ago, rises, heavily. He shakes hands with Lewis.","Layman: Might not see y again befo y leave, Mr. Lewis. I enjoys t hear y talk. Y might have been a preacher. Maybe a bishop some day. Sho do hope t see y back this away again sometime, Mr. Lewis.","Lewis: Thanks, Professor. Hope I’ll see you.","Layman waves a long arm loosely to the others, and leaves. Kabnis goes to the door. His eyes, sullen, gaze up the street.","Kabnis: Carrie K.’s comin with th lunch. Bout time.","She passes the window. Her red girl’s-cap, catching the sun, flashes vividly. With a stiff, awkward little movement she crosses the door-sill and gives Kabnis one of the two baskets which she is carrying. There is a slight stoop to her shoulders. The curves of her body blend with this to a soft rounded charm. Her gestures are stiffly variant. Black bangs curl over the forehead of her oval-olive face. Her expression is dazed, but on provocation it can melt into a wistful smile. Adolescent. She is easily the sister of Fred Halsey.","Carrie K.: Mother says excuse her, brother Fred an Ralph, fer bein late.","Kabnis: Everythings all right an O.K., Carrie Kate. O.K. an all right.","The two men settle on their lunch. Carrie, with hardly a glance in the direction of the hearth, as is her habit, is about to take the second basket down to the old man, when Lewis rises. In doing so he draws her unwitting attention. Their meeting is a swift sun-burst. Lewis impulsively moves towards her. His mind flashes images of her life in the southern town. He sees the nascent woman, her flesh already stiffening to cartilage, drying to bone. Her spirit-bloom, even now touched sullen, bitter. Her rich beauty fading... He wants to- He stretches forth his hands to hers. He takes them. They feel like warm cheeks against his palms. The sun-burst from her eyes floods up and haloes him. Christ-eyes, his eyes look to her. Fearlessly she loves into them. And then something happens. Her face blanches. Awkwardly she draws away. The sin-bogies of respectable southern colored folks clamor at her: “Look out! Be a good girl. A good girl. Look out!” She gropes for her basket that has fallen to the floor. Finds it, and marches with a rigid gravity to her task of feeding the old man. Like the glowing white ash of burned paper, Lewis’ eyelids, wavering, settle down. He stirs in the direction of the rear window. From the back yard, mules tethered to odd trees and posts blink dumbly at him. They too seem burdened with an impotent pain. Kabnis and Halsey are still busy with their lunch. They havent noticed him. After a while he turns to them.","Lewis: Your sister, Halsey, whats to become of her? What are you going to do for her?","Halsey: Who? What? What am I goin t do?..","Lewis: What I mean is, what does she do down there?","Halsey: Oh. Feeds th old man. Had lunch, Lewis?","Lewis: Thanks, yes. You have never felt her, have you, Halsey? Well, no, I guess not. I dont suppose you can. Nor can she... Old man? Halsey, some one lives down there? I’ve never heard of him. Tell me-","Kabnis takes time from his meal to answer with some emphasis:","Kabnis: Theres lots of things you aint heard of.","Lewis: Dare say. I’d like to see him.","Kabnis: You’ll get all th chance you want tnight.","Halsey: Fixin a little somethin up fer tnight, Lewis. Th three of us an some girls. Come round bout ten-thirty.","Lewis: Glad to. But what under the sun does he do down there?","Halsey: Ask Kabnis. He blows off t him every chance he gets.","Kabnis gives a grunting laugh. His mouth twists. Carrie returns from the cellar. Avoiding Lewis, she speaks to her brother.","Carrie K.: Brother Fred, father hasnt eaten now goin on th second week, but mumbles an talks funny, or tries t talk when I put his hands ont th food. He frightens me, an I dunno what t do. An oh, I came near fergettin, brother, but Mr. Marmon-he was eatin lunch when I saw him-told me t tell y that th lumber wagon busted down an he wanted y t fix it fer him. Said he reckoned he could get it t y after he ate.","Halsey chucks a half-eaten sandwich in the fire. Gets up. Arranges his blocks. Goes to the door and looks anxiously up the street. The wind whirls a small spiral in the gray dust road.","Halsey: Why didnt y tell me sooner, little sister?","Carrie K.: I fergot t, an just remembered it now, brother.","Her soft rolled words are fresh pain to Lewis. He wants to take her North with him. What for? He wonders what Kabnis could do for her. What she could do for him. Mother him. Carrie gathers the lunch things, silently, and in her pinched manner, curtsies, and departs. Kabnis lights his after-lunch cigarette. Lewis, who has sensed a change, becomes aware that he is not included in it. He starts to ask again about the old man. Decides not to. Rises to go.","Lewis: Think I’ll run along, Halsey.","Halsey: Sure. Glad t see y any time.","Kabnis: Dont forget tnight.","Lewis: Dont worry. I wont. So long.","Kabnis: So long. We’ll be expectin y.","Lewis passes Halsey at the door. Halsey’s cheeks form a vacant smile. His eyes are wide awake, watching for the wagon to turn from Broad Street into his road.","Halsey: So long.","His words reach Lewis halfway to the corner.","5","Night, soft belly of a pregnant Negress, throbs evenly against the torso of the South. Night throbs a womb-song to the South. Cane- and cotton-fields, pine forests, cypress swamps, sawmills, and factories are fecund at her touch. Night’s womb-song sets them singing. Night winds are the breathing of the unborn child whose calm throbbing in the belly of a Negress sets them somnolently singing. Hear their song.","White-man’s land.","Niggers, sing.","Burn, bear black children","Till poor rivers bring","Rest, and sweet glory","In Camp Ground.","Sempter’s streets are vacant and still. White paint on the wealthier houses has the chill blue glitter of distant stars. Negro cabins are a purple blur. Broad Street is deserted. Winds stir beneath the corrugated iron canopies and dangle odd bits of rope tied to horse- and mule-gnawed hitching-posts. One store window has a light in it. Chesterfield cigarette and Chero-Cola cardboard advertisements are stacked in it. From a side door two men come out. Pause, for a last word and then say good night. Soon they melt in shadows thicker than they. Way off down the street four figures sway beneath iron awnings which form a sort of corridor that imperfectly echoes and jumbles what they say. A fifth form joins them. They turn into the road that leads to Halsey’s workshop. The old building is phosphorescent above deep shade. The figures pass through the double door. Night winds whisper in the eaves. Sing weirdly in the ceiling cracks. Stir curls of shavings on the floor. Halsey lights a candle. A good-sized lumber wagon, wheels off, rests upon the blocks. Kabnis makes a face at it. An unearthly hush is upon the place. No one seems to want to talk. To move, lest the scraping of their feet..","Halsey: Come on down this way, folks.","He leads the way. Stella follows. And close after her, Cora, Lewis, and Kabnis. They descend into the Hole. It seems huge, limitless in the candle light. The walls are of stone, wonderfully fitted. They have no openings save a small iron-barred window toward the top of each. They are dry and warm. The ground slopes away to the rear of the building and thus leaves the south wall exposed to the sun. The blacksmith’s shop is plumb against the right wall. The floor is clay. Shavings have at odd times been matted into it. In the right-hand corner, under the stairs, two good-sized pine mattresses, resting on cardboard, are on either side of a wooden table. On this are several half-burned candles and an oil lamp. Behind the table, an irregular piece of mirror hangs on the wall. A loose something that looks to be a gaudy ball costume dangles from a near-by hook. To the front, a second table holds a lamp and several whiskey glasses. Six rickety chairs are near this table. Two old wagon wheels rest on the floor. To the left, sitting in a high-backed chair which stands upon a low platform, the old man. He is like a bust in black walnut. Gray-bearded. Gray-haired. Prophetic. Immobile. Lewis’ eyes are sunk in him. The others, unconcerned, are about to pass on to the front table when Lewis grips Halsey and so turns him that the candle flame shines obliquely on the old man’s features.","Lewis: And he rules over-","Kabnis: Th smoke an fire of th forge.","Lewis: Black Vulcan? I wouldnt say so. That forehead. Great woolly beard. Those eyes. A mute John the Baptist of a new religion-or a tongue-tied shadow of an old.","Kabnis: His tongue is tied all right, an I can vouch f that.","Lewis: Has he never talked to you?","Halsey: Kabnis wont give him a chance.","He laughs. The girls laugh. Kabnis winces.","Lewis: What do you call him?","Halsey: Father.","Lewis: Good. Father what?","Kabnis: Father of hell.","Halsey: Father’s th only name we have fer him. Come on. Lets sit down an get t th pleasure of the evenin.","Lewis: Father John it is from now on...","Slave boy whom some Christian mistress taught to read the Bible. Black man who saw Jesus in the ricefields, and began preaching to his people. Moses- and Christ-words used for songs. Dead blind father of a muted folk who feel their way upward to a life that crushes or absorbs them. (Speak, Father!) Suppose your eyes could see, old man. (The years hold hands. O Sing!) Suppose your lips...","Halsey, does he never talk?","Halsey: Na. But sometimes. Only seldom. Mumbles. Sis says he talks-","Kabnis: I’ve heard him talk.","Halsey: First I’ve ever heard of it. You dont give him a chance. Sis says she’s made out several words, mostly one-an like as not cause it was “sin.”","Kabnis: All those old fogies stutter about sin.","Cora laughs in a loose sort of way. She is a tall, thin, mulatto woman. Her eyes are deep-set behind a pointed nose. Her hair is coarse and bushy. Seeing that Stella also is restless, she takes her arm and the two women move towards the table. They slip into chairs. Halsey follows and lights the lamp. He lays out a pack of cards. Stella sorts them as if telling fortunes. She is a beautifully proportioned, large-eyed, brown-skin girl. Except for the twisted line of her mouth when she smiles or laughs, there is about her no suggestion of the life she’s been through. Kabnis, with great mock-solemnity, goes to the corner, takes down the robe, and dons it. He is a curious spectacle, acting a part, yet very real. He joins the others at the table. They are used to him. Lewis is surprised. He laughs. Kabnis shrinks and then glares at him with a furtive hatred. Halsey, bringing out a bottle of corn licker, pours drinks.","Halsey: Come on, Lewis. Come on, you fellers. Heres lookin at y.","Then, as if suddenly recalling something, he jerks away from the table and starts towards the steps.","Kabnis: Where y goin, Halsey?","Halsey: Where? Where y think? That oak beam in th wagon-","Kabnis: Come ere. Come ere. Sit down. What in hell’s wrong with you fellers? You with your wagon. Lewis with his Father John. This aint th time fer foolin with wagons. Daytime’s bad enough f that. Ere, sit down. Ere, Lewis, you too sit down. Have a drink. Thats right. Drink corn licker, love th girls, an listen t th old man mumblin sin.","There seems to be no good-time spirit to the party. Something in the air is too tense and deep for that. Lewis, seated now so that his eyes rest upon the old man, merges with his source and lets the pain and beauty of the South meet him there. White faces, pain-pollen, settle downward through a cane-sweet mist and touch the215 ovaries of yellow flowers. Cotton-bolls bloom, droop. Black roots twist in a parched red soil beneath a blazing sky. Magnolias, fragrant, a trifle futile, lovely, far off... His eyelids close. A force begins to heave and rise... Stella is serious, reminiscent.","Stella: Usall is brought up t hate sin worse than death-","Kabnis: An then before you have y eyes half open, youre made t love it if y want t live.","Stella: Us never-","Kabnis: Oh, I know your story: that old prim bastard over yonder, an then old Calvert’s office-","Stella: It wasnt them-","Kabnis: I know. They put y out of church, an then I guess th preacher came around an asked f some. But thats your body. Now me-","Halsey (passing him the bottle): All right, kid, we believe y. Here, take another. Wheres Clover, Stel?","Stella: You know how Jim is when he’s just out th swamp. Done up in shine an wouldnt let her come. Said he’d bust her head open if she went out.","Kabnis: Dont see why he doesnt stay over with Laura, where he belongs.","Stella: Ask him, an I reckon he’ll tell y. More than you want.","Halsey: Th nigger hates th sight of a black woman worse than death. Sorry t mix y up this way, Lewis. But y see how tis.","Lewis’ skin is tight and glowing over the fine bones of his face. His lips tremble. His nostrils quiver. The others notice this and smile knowingly at each other. Drinks and smokes are passed around. They pay no neverminds to him. A real party is being worked up. Then Lewis opens his eyes and looks at them. Their smiles disperse in hot-cold tremors. Kabnis chokes his laugh. It sputters, gurgles. His eyes flicker and turn away. He tries to pass the thing off by taking a long drink which he makes considerable fuss over. He is drawn back to Lewis. Seeing Lewis’ gaze still upon him, he scowls.","Kabnis: Whatsha lookin at me for? Y want t know who I am? Well, I’m Ralph Kabnis-lot of good its goin t do y. Well? Whatsha keep lookin for? I’m Ralph Kabnis. Aint that enough f y? Want th whole family history? Its none of your godam business, anyway. Keep off me. Do y hear? Keep off me. Look at Cora. Aint she pretty enough t look at? Look at Halsey, or Stella. Clover ought t be here an you could look at her. An love her. Thats what you need. I know-","Lewis: Ralph Kabnis gets satisfied that way?","Kabnis: Satisfied? Say, quit your kiddin. Here, look at that old man there. See him? He’s satisfied. Do I look like him? When I’m dead I dont expect t be satisfied. Is that enough f y, with your godam nosin, or do you want more? Well, y wont get it, understand?","Lewis: The old man as symbol, flesh, and spirit of the past, what do think he would say if he could see you? You look at him, Kabnis.","Kabnis: Just like any done-up preacher is what he looks t me. Jam some false teeth in his mouth and crank him, an youd have God Almighty spit in torrents all around th floor. Oh, hell, an he reminds me of that black cockroach over yonder. An besides, he aint my past. My ancestors were Southern blue-bloods-","Lewis: And black.","Kabnis: Aint much difference between blue an black.","Lewis: Enough to draw a denial from you. Cant hold them, can you? Master; slave. Soil; and the overarching heavens. Dusk; dawn. They fight and bastardize you. The sun tint of your cheeks, flame of the great season’s multi-colored leaves, tarnished, burned. Split, shredded: easily burned. No use...","His gaze shifts to Stella. Stella’s face draws back, her breasts come towards him.","Stella: I aint got nothin f y, mister. Taint no use t look at me.","Halsey: Youre a queer feller, Lewis, I swear y are. Told y so, didnt I, girls? Just take him easy though, an he’ll be ridin just th same as any Georgia mule, eh, Lewis? (Laughs.)","Stella: I’m goin t tell y somethin, mister. It aint t you, t th Mister Lewis what noses about. Its t somethin different, I dunno what. That old man there-maybe its him-is like m father used t look. He used t sing. An when he could sing no mo, they’d allus come f him an carry him t church an there he’d sit, befo th pulpit, aswayin219 an aleadin every song. A white man took m mother an it broke th old man’s heart. He died; an then I didnt care what become of me, an I dont now. I dont care now. Dont get it in y head I’m some sentimental Susie askin for yo sop. Nassur. But theres somethin t yo th others aint got. Boars an kids an fools-thats all I’ve known. Boars when their fever’s up. When their fever’s up they come t me. Halsey asks me over when he’s off th job. Kabnis-it ud be a sin t play with him. He takes it out in talk.","Halsey knows that he has trifled with her. At odd things he has been inwardly penitent before her tasking him. But now he wants to hurt her. He turns to Lewis.","Halsey: Lewis, I got a little licker in me, an thats true. True’s what I said. True. But th stuff just seems t wake me up an make my mind a man of me. Listen. You know a lot, queer as hell as y are, an I want t ask y some questions. Theyre too high fer them, Stella an Cora an Kabnis, so we’ll just excuse em. A chat between ourselves. (Turns to the others.) Youall cant listen in on this. Twont interest y. So just leave th table t this gen’lemun an myself. Go long now.","Kabnis gets up, pompous in his robe, grotesquely so, and makes as if to go through a grand march with Stella. She shoves him off, roughly, and in a mood swings her body to the steps. Kabnis grabs Cora and parades around, passing the old man, to whom he bows in mock-curtsy. He sweeps by the table, snatches the licker bottle, and then he and Cora sprawl on the mattresses. She meets his weak approaches after the manner she thinks Stella would use.","Halsey contemptuously watches them until he is sure that they are settled.","Halsey: This aint th sort o thing f me, Lewis, when I got work upstairs. Nassur. You an me has got things t do. Wastin time on common low-down women-say, Lewis, look at her now-Stella-aint she a picture? Common wench-na she aint, Lewis. You know she aint. I’m only tryin t fool y. I used t love that girl. Yassur. An sometimes when th moon is thick an I hear dogs up th valley barkin an some old woman fetches out her song, an th winds seem like th Lord made them fer t fetch an carry th smell o pine an cane, an there aint no big job on foot, I sometimes get t thinkin that I still do. But I want t talk t y, Lewis, queer as y are. Y know, Lewis, I went t school once. Ya. In Augusta. But it wasnt a regular school. Na. It was a pussy Sunday-school masqueradin under a regular name. Some goody-goody teachers from th North had come down t teach th niggers. If you was nearly white, they liked y. If you was black, they didnt. But it wasnt that-I was all right, y see. I couldnt stand em messin an pawin over m business like I was a child. So I cussed em out an left. Kabnis there ought t have cussed out th old duck over yonder an left. He’d a been a better man tday. But as I was sayin, I couldnt stand their ways. So I left an came here an worked with my father. An been here ever since. He died. I set in f myself. An its always been; give me a good job an sure pay an I aint far from being satisfied, so far as satisfaction goes. Prejudice is everywheres about this country. An a nigger aint in much standin anywheres. But when it comes t pottin round an doin nothing, with nothin bigger’n an ax-handle t hold a feller down, like it was a while back befo I got this job-that beam ought t be-but tmorrow mornin early’s time enough f that. As I was sayin, I gets t thinkin. Play dumb naturally t white folks. I gets t thinkin. I used to subscribe t th Literary Digest an that helped along a bit. But there werent nothing I could sink m teeth int. Theres lots I want t ask y, Lewis. Been askin y t come around. Couldnt get y. Cant get in much tnight. (He glances at the others. His mind fastens on Kabnis.) Say, tell me this, whats on your mind t say on that feller there? Kabnis’ name. One queer bird ought t know another, seems like t me.","Licker has released conflicts in Kabnis and set them flowing. He pricks his ears, intuitively feels that the talk is about him, leaves Cora, and approaches the table. His eyes are watery, heavy with passion. He stoops. He is a ridiculous pathetic figure in his showy robe.","Kabnis: Talkin bout me. I know. I’m th topic of conversation everywhere theres talk about this town. Girls an fellers. White folks as well. An if its me youre talkin bout, guess I got a right t listen in. Whats sayin? Whats sayin bout his royal guts, the Duke? Whats sayin, eh?","Halsey (to Lewis): We’ll take it up another time.","Kabnis: No nother time bout it Now. I’m here now an talkin’s just begun. I was born an bred in a family of orators, thats what I was.","Halsey: Preachers.","Kabnis: Na. Preachers hell. I didnt say wind-busters. Y misapprehended me. Y understand what that means, dont y? All right then, y misapprehended me. I didnt say preachers. I said orators. ORATORS. Born one an I’ll die one. You understand me, Lewis. (He turns to Halsey and begins shaking his finger in his face.) An as f you, youre all right f choppin things from blocks of wood. I was good at that th day I ducked th cradle. An since then, I’ve been shapin words after a design that branded here. Know whats here? M soul. Ever heard o that? Th hell y have. Been shapin words t fit m soul. Never told y that before, did I? Thought I couldnt talk. I’ll tell y. I’ve been shapin words; ah, but sometimes theyre beautiful an golden an have a taste that makes them fine t roll over with y tongue. Your tongue aint fit f nothin but t roll an lick hog-meat.","Stella and Cora come up to the table.","Halsey: Give him a shove there, will y, Stel?","Stella jams Kabnis in a chair. Kabnis springs up.","Kabnis: Cant keep a good man down. Those words I was tellin y about, they wont fit int th mold thats branded on m soul. Rhyme, y see? Poet, too. Bad rhyme. Bad poet. Somethin else youve learned tnight. Lewis dont know it all, an I’m atellin y. Ugh. Th form thats burned int my soul is some twisted awful thing that crept in from a dream, a godam nightmare, an wont stay still unless I feed it. An it lives on words. Not beautiful words. God Almighty no. Misshapen, split-gut, tortured, twisted words. Layman was feedin it back there that day you thought I ran out fearin things. White folks feed it cause their looks are words. Niggers, black niggers feed it cause theyre evil an their looks are words. Yallar niggers feed it. This whole damn bloated purple country feeds it cause its goin down t hell in a holy avalanche of words. I want t feed th soul-I know what that is; th preachers dont-but I’ve got t feed it. I wish t God some lynchin white man ud225 stick his knife through it an pin it to a tree. An pin it to a tree. You hear me? Thats a wish f y, you little snot-nosed pups who’ve been makin fun of me, an fakin that I’m weak. Me, Ralph Kabnis weak. Ha.","Halsey: Thats right, old man. There, there. Here, so much exertion merits a fittin reward. Help him t be seated, Cora.","Halsey gives him a swig of shine. Cora glides up, seats him, and then plumps herself down on his lap, squeezing his head into her breasts. Kabnis mutters. Tries to break loose. Curses. Cora almost stifles him. He goes limp and gives up. Cora toys with him. Ruffles his hair. Braids it. Parts it in the middle. Stella smiles contemptuously. And then a sudden anger sweeps her. She would like to lash Cora from the place. She’d like to take Kabnis to some distant pine grove and nurse and mother him. Her eyes flash. A quick tensioning throws her breasts and neck into a poised strain. She starts towards them. Halsey grabs her arm and pulls her to him. She struggles. Halsey pins her arms and kisses her. She settles, spurting like a pine-knot afire.","Lewis finds himself completely cut out. The glowing within him subsides. It is followed by a dead chill. Kabnis, Carrie, Stella, Halsey, Cora, the old man, the cellar, and the work-shop, the southern town descend upon him. Their pain is too intense. He cannot stand it. He bolts from the table. Leaps up the stairs. Plunges through the work-shop and out into the night.","6","The cellar swims in a pale phosphorescence. The table, the chairs, the figure of the old man are amœba-like shadows which move about and float in it. In the corner under the steps, close to the floor, a solid blackness. A sound comes from it. A forcible yawn. Part of the blackness detaches itself so that it may be seen against the grayness of the wall. It moves forward and then seems to be clothing itself in odd dangling bits of shadow. The voice of Halsey, vibrant and deepened, calls.","Halsey: Kabnis. Cora. Stella.","He gets no response. He wants to get them up, to get on the job. He is intolerant of their sleepiness.","Halsey: Kabnis! Stella! Cora!","Gutturals, jerky and impeded, tell that he is shaking them.","Halsey: Come now, up with you.","Kabnis (sleepily and still more or less intoxicated): Whats th big idea? What in hell-","Halsey: Work. But never you mind about that. Up with you.","Cora: Oooooo! Look here, mister, I aint used t bein thrown int th street befo day.","Stella: Any bunk whats worked is worth in wages moren this. But come on. Taint no use t arger.","Kabnis: I’ll arger. Its preposterous-","The girls interrupt him with none too pleasant laughs.","Kabnis: Thats what I said. Know what it means, dont y? All right, then. I said its preposterous t root an artist out o bed at this ungodly hour, when there aint no use t it. You can start your damned old work. Nobody’s stoppin y. But what we got t get up for? Fraid somebody’ll see th girls leavin? Some sport, you are. I hand it t y.","Halsey: Up you get, all th same.","Kabnis: Oh, th hell you say.","Halsey: Well, son, seeing that I’m th kind-hearted father, I’ll give y chance t open your eyes. But up y get when I come down.","He mounts the steps to the work-shop and starts a fire in the hearth. In the yard he finds some chunks of coal which he brings in and throws on the fire. He puts a kettle on to boil. The wagon draws him. He lifts an oak-beam, fingers it, and becomes abstracted. Then comes to himself and places the beam upon the work-bench. He looks over some newly cut wooden spokes. He goes to the fire and pokes it. The coals are red-hot. With a pair of long prongs he picks them up and places them in a thick iron bucket. This he carries downstairs. Outside, darkness has given way to the impalpable grayness of dawn. This early morning light, seeping through the four barred cellar windows, is the color of the stony walls. It seems to be an emanation from them. Halsey’s coals throw out a rich warm glow. He sets them on the floor, a safe distance from the beds.","Halsey: No foolin now. Come. Up with you.","Other than a soft rustling, there is no sound as the girls slip into their clothes. Kabnis still lies in bed.","Stella (to Halsey): Reckon y could spare us a light?","Halsey strikes a match, lights a cigarette, and then bends over and touches flame to the two candles on the table between the beds. Kabnis asks for a cigarette. Halsey hands him his and takes a fresh one for himself. The girls, before the mirror, are doing up their hair. It is bushy hair that has gone through some straightening process. Character, however, has not all been ironed out. As they kneel there, heavy-eyed and dusky, and throwing grotesque moving shadows on the wall, they are two princesses in Africa going through the early-morning ablutions of their pagan prayers. Finished, they come forward to stretch their hands and warm them over the glowing coals. Red dusk of a Georgia sun230set, their heavy, coal-lit faces... Kabnis suddenly recalls something.","Kabnis: Th old man talked last night.","Stella: An so did you.","Halsey: In your dreams.","Kabnis: I tell y, he did. I know what I’m talkin about. I’ll tell y what he said. Wait now, lemme see.","Halsey: Look out, brother, th old man’ll be getting int you by way o dreams. Come, Stel, ready? Cora? Coffee an eggs f both of you.","Halsey goes upstairs.","Stella: Gettin generous, aint he?","She blows the candles out. Says nothing to Kabnis. Then she and Cora follow after Halsey. Kabnis, left to himself, tries to rise. He has slept in his robe. His robe trips him. Finally, he manages to stand up. He starts across the floor. Half-way to the old man, he falls and lies quite still. Perhaps an hour passes. Light of a new sun is about to filter through the windows. Kabnis slowly rises to support upon his elbows. He looks hard, and internally gathers himself together. The side face of Father John is in the direct line of his eyes. He scowls at him. No one is around. Words gush from Kabnis.","Kabnis: You sit there like a black hound spiked to an ivory pedestal. An all night long I heard you murmurin that devilish word. They thought I didnt hear y, but I did. Mumblin, feedin that ornery thing thats livin on my insides. Father John. Father of Satan, more likely. What does it mean t you? Youre dead already. Death. What does it mean t you? To you who died way back there in th 'sixties. What are y throwin it in my throat for? Whats it goin t get y? A good smashin in th mouth, thats what. My fist’ll sink int y black mush face clear t y guts-if y got any. Dont believe y have. Never seen signs of none. Death. Death. Sin an Death. All night long y mumbled death. (He forgets the old man as his mind begins to play with the word and its associations.) Death ... these clammy floors ... just like th place they used t stow away th worn-out, no-count niggers in th days of slavery ... that was long ago; not so long ago ... no windows (he rises higher on his elbows to verify this assertion. He looks around, and, seeing no one but the old man, calls.) Halsey! Halsey! Gone an left me. Just like a nigger. I thought he was a nigger all th time. Now I know it. Ditch y when it comes right down t it. Damn him anyway. Godam him. (He looks and re-sees the old man.) Eh, you? T hell with you too. What do I care whether you can see or hear? You know what hell is cause youve been there. Its a feelin an its ragin in my soul in a way that’ll pop out of me an run you through, an scorch y, an burn an rip your soul. Your soul. Ha. Nigger soul. A gin soul that gets drunk on a preacher’s words. An screams. An shouts. God Almighty, how I hate that shoutin. Where’s th beauty in that? Gives a buzzard a windpipe an I’ll bet a dollar t a dime th buzzard ud beat y to it. Aint surprisin th white folks hate y so. When you had eyes, did you ever see th beauty of th world? Tell me that. Th hell y did. Now dont tell me. I know y didnt. You couldnt have. Oh, I’m drunk an just as good as dead, but no eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their sight. You aint got no sight. If you had, drunk as I am, I hope Christ will kill me if I couldnt see it. Your eyes are dull and watery, like fish eyes. Fish eyes are dead eyes. Youre an old man, a dead fish man, an black at that. Theyve put y here t die, damn fool y are not t know it. Do y know how many feet youre under ground? I’ll tell y. Twenty. An do y think you’ll ever see th light of day again, even if you wasnt blind? Do y think youre out of slavery? Huh? Youre where they used t throw th worked-out, no-count slaves. On a damp clammy floor of a dark scum-hole. An they called that an infirmary. Th sons-a.... Why I can already see you toppled off that stool an stretched out on th floor beside me-not beside me, damn you, by yourself, with th flies buzzin an lickin God knows what they’d find on a dirty, black, foul-breathed mouth like yours...","Some one is coming down the stairs. Carrie, bringing food for the old man. She is lovely in her fresh energy of the morning, in the calm untested confidence and nascent maternity which rise from the purpose of her present mission. She walks to within a few paces of Kabnis.","Carrie K.: Brother says come up now, brother Ralph.","Kabnis: Brother doesnt know what he’s talkin bout.","Carrie K.: Yes he does, Ralph. He needs you on th wagon.","Kabnis: He wants me on th wagon, eh? Does he think some wooden thing can lift me up? Ask him that.","Carrie K.: He told me t help y.","Kabnis: An how would you help me, child, dear sweet little sister?","She moves forward as if to aid him.","Carrie K.: I’m not a child, as I’ve more than once told you, brother Ralph, an as I’ll show you now.","Kabnis: Wait, Carrie. No, thats right. Youre not a child. But twont do t lift me bodily. You dont understand. But its th soul of me that needs th risin.","Carrie K: Youre a bad brother an just wont listen t me when I’m tellin y t go t church.","Kabnis doesnt hear her. He breaks down and talks to himself.","Kabnis: Great God Almighty, a soul like mine cant pin itself onto a wagon wheel an satisfy itself in spinnin round. Iron prongs an hickory sticks, an God knows what all ... all right for Halsey ... use him. Me? I get my life down in this scum-hole. Th old man an me-","Carrie K.: Has he been talkin?","Kabnis: Huh? Who? Him? No. Dont need to. I talk. An when I really talk, it pays th best of them t listen. Th old man is a good listener. He’s deaf; but he’s a good listener. An I can talk t him. Tell him anything.","Carrie K.: He’s deaf an blind, but I reckon he hears, an sees too, from th things I’ve heard.","Kabnis: No. Cant. Cant I tell you. How’s he do it?","Carrie K.: Dunno, except I’ve heard that th souls of old folks have a way of seein things.","Kabnis: An I’ve heard them call that superstition.","The old man begins to shake his head slowly. Carrie and Kabnis watch him, anxiously. He mumbles. With a grave motion his head nods up and down. And then, on one of the down-swings-","Father John (remarkably clear and with great conviction): Sin.","He repeats this word several times, always the downward nodding. Surprised, indignant, Kabnis forgets that Carrie is with him.","Kabnis: Sin! Shut up. What do you know about sin, you old black bastard. Shut up, an stop that swayin an noddin your head.","Father John: Sin.","Kabnis tries to get up.","Kabnis: Didnt I tell y t shut up?","Carrie steps forward to help him. Kabnis is violently shocked at her touch. He springs back.","Kabnis: Carrie! What .. how .. Baby, you shouldnt be down here. Ralph says things. Doesnt mean to. But Carrie, he doesnt know what he’s talkin about. Couldnt know. It was only a preacher’s sin they knew in those old days, an that wasnt sin at all. Mind me, th only sin is whats done against th soul. Th whole world is a conspiracy t sin, especially in America, an against me. I’m th victim of their sin. I’m what sin is. Does he look like me? Have you ever heard him say th things youve heard me say? He couldnt if he had th Holy Ghost t help him. Dont look shocked, little sweetheart, you hurt me.","Father John: Sin.","Kabnis: Aw, shut up, old man.","Carrie K.: Leave him be. He wants t say somethin. (She turns to the old man.) What is it, Father?","Kabnis: Whatsha talkin t that old deaf man for? Come away from him.","Carrie K.: What is it, Father?","The old man’s lips begin to work. Words are formed incoherently. Finally, he manages to articulate-","Father John: Th sin whats fixed... (Hesitates.)","Carrie K. (restraining a comment from Kabnis): Go on, Father.","Father John: ... upon th white folks-","Kabnis: Suppose youre talkin about that bastard race thats roamin round th country. It looks like sin, if thats what y mean. Give us somethin new an up t date.","Father John:-f tellin Jesus-lies. O th sin th white folks 'mitted when they made th Bible lie.","Boom. Boom. BOOM! Thuds on the floor above. The old man sinks back into his stony silence. Carrie is wet-eyed. Kabnis, contemptuous.","Kabnis: So thats your sin. All these years t tell us that th white folks made th Bible lie. Well, I’ll be damned. Lewis ought t have been here. You old black fakir-","Carrie K.: Brother Ralph, is that your best Amen?","She turns him to her and takes his hot cheeks in her firm cool hands. Her palms draw the fever out. With its passing, Kabnis crumples. He sinks to his knees before her, ashamed, exhausted. His eyes squeeze tight. Carrie presses his face tenderly against her. The suffocation of her fresh starched dress feels good to him. Carrie is about to lift her hands in prayer, when Halsey, at the head of the stairs, calls down.","Halsey: Well, well. Whats up? Aint you ever comin? Come on. Whats up down there? Take you all mornin t sleep off a pint? Youre weakenin, man, youre weakenin. Th axle an th beam’s all ready waitin f y. Come on.","Kabnis rises and is going doggedly towards the steps. Carrie notices his robe. She catches up to him, points to it, and helps him take it off. He hangs it, with an exaggerated ceremony, on its nail in the corner. He looks down on the tousled beds. His lips curl bitterly. Turning, he stumbles over the bucket of dead coals. He savagely jerks it from the floor. And then, seeing Carrie’s eyes upon him, he swings the pail carelessly and with eyes downcast and swollen, trudges upstairs to the work-shop. Carrie’s gaze follows him till he is gone. Then she goes to the old man and slips to her knees before him. Her lips murmur, “Jesus, come.”","Light streaks through the iron-barred cellar window. Within its soft circle, the figures of Carrie and Father John.","Outside, the sun arises from its cradle in the tree-tops of the forest. Shadows of pines are dreams the sun shakes from its eyes. The sun arises. Gold-glowing child, it steps into the sky and sends a birth-song slanting down gray dust streets and sleepy windows of the southern town.","THE END"],"labels":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}

Reflecting shot from the glass capturing both of the guards though resting are easily still tensed up from their surrounding environment, another bomb shell hitting around the complex to send minor vibrations through their level.","Always read the fine print.","Page 6","1.) POV shot almost from Guard 2’s position looking over at Guard 1 while he hunches over in his seat, his arms settled on his legs while he lets out a defeated sigh and stares out of the station into the hallway.","I just want to know why would they would keep us here in the","first place.","2.) Shot of Guard 2, angled above the desk from inside of the glass. Guard 2 is still relaxing as he turns his eyes back towards the clock, prepared for the nightly routine.","You know... I remember before shit hit the fan and we were still warring with the cartels pushing enhancements deep into Africa, this is when human trafficking was pushed back into an all-time high. My unit was called into this hot little trading area in a town on the outskirts of Cape Verde.","3.) POV shot from the elevator, the corridor of cells showing in front with the security station off to the right, Guard 2 still in sight.","The mission of course seemed simple enough, extract a shipment of candidates and tag one of the head runners while we were at it. We suspected the source to be this packed community health center offering free vaccinations for the earlier attacks. Me and another squad-mate for the time being posed as inspectors, checking out credentials and everything seemed copacetic.","4.) Pan to one of the cell doors, the dull tan in contrast with the still gray-cement surroundings treating the area like a traditional element out of Alcatraz or solitary confinement with a keycard slot accompanying to the right.","We would’ve staked them out a few days, nothing major otherwise noticed but... that examination room let out a foul air and I think whoever ran the program knew they couldn’t get rid of the body fast enough. Probably someone who could tell a little too late that the vaccine came with some additional strings. Either way, we could tell by the time that whole floor reacted that the rest of the town would be the same.","Page 7","1.) Guard 1 cuts back to Guard 2, then remembering hearing this same story only told through reasonable means to newspapers and redacted reports through his peers, even during that time just starting his work on classified missions but nothing of that nature.","So Cape Verde was--","2.) Guard 2 is almost storytelling through a means of PTSD, His eyes still staring at the clock but otherwise solely still memorized by the event.","Yeah...","3.) Guard 2 settles out of his relaxing position, his retelling of the story almost how you would imagine a client talking to his counselor, of all the operations he’s been in, this was the most infamous and no matter what the result seemed, nobody came out a winner in the end.","Ghost In The Machine. The only reason we got out alive was because of the portable EMPs, still prototypes at that. If that couldn’t knock them out for the windows we had we would’ve been torn apart in God knows how many directions.","4.) Guard 1 is almost shifting in his seat from subject. Out","of all the events that led to this scenario, the truth within","this event was easily within the top 3.","But I thought the reports--","5.) Guard 2 snaps out of his almost comatose state with his sight shifting back towards Guard 1, well aware of what the reports said and if anything near a traitor himself for wanting to expose the bastards that helped cover it up.","An 8-year-old girl almost sliced my face apart with a shard of glass. It wasn’t just that the people had already gotten implanted and went wrong. It wasn’t a group of insurgents tampering with their blood. The cartel had already herded people through safety and developed a program to control an entire town. What the fuck makes these bastard’s tactics any different?","6.) Before the conversation can go any further, the clock","strikes 2:00 A.M., the BEEP along with it signaling the","coming of the specially regulated food cart for the cargo.","Well shit... looks like it’s feeding time.","Page 8","1.) Image from behind of the guards waiting patiently for the elevator’s shipment of food, door closed with no notification of the floor it’s headed to past the previous alarm from the clock.","2.) The elevator door opens to an open area large enough to carry five tons of weight for industrial and scientific purposes, in this case carrying nothing but a 3 shelve catering cart, stocked to the brim with food trays. In place of what would usually constitute as food is what looks like a larger, sloppy version of nutraloaf, bare bottom prison food for prisoners basically.","3.) The 2 guards begin moving the cart forward into the hallway, one on each side handling the cart in coordination step-by step before reaching the cells.","Page 9","1.) Cue later down the hallway getting down to the last few cells, image from behind of the two guards moving the cart near the last 3 cells.","2 - 6 Repeating panels.","2.) The guards each grab one of the few remaining food trays before reaching down to hand it through the food slot.","3.) Most of the prisoners have little awareness to the fact they’re even getting food, image of the guards forcibly shoving the trays through their slots.","4.)","5.)","6.)","7.) Guard #1 this time in efforts of instead of forcibly shoving the last try into the cell is greedily taken from his palm and into the cell.","Page 10","(Fell out of focus for the panels, will keep story written down but some pages may or may not have panels specifically listed.)","Once the guard stands back to his feet, the look on his face is a solid mixture of puzzled and surprised, this being the first time and weeks either guard has been even able to see a prisoner actually make a notable attempt towards their meal. Then again, the guards wouldn’t be able to argue with the food being just enough to let each person in their cell live.","Well that’s a first...","First for what?","Guard 2 gives a glance over at the other.","One of ‘em is actually hungry for a change. Actually...","Guard 1’s concerned glance only becomes worse as he makes","note of the prisoner’s recent import.","Did you notice anything strange abou--","Before the guard can finish his thought process another bomb","hits the area of the complex, directly on top of it and this time it seemingly penetrates, causing the facility to quake in place along with causing enough of a disruption to dim the lights. Each guard looks at each other knowing the exact type of moment this was before sprinting back towards the guard post, a raid.","Page 11","Once both guards reach their posts, they look through the ground security cameras, the environment surrounding looking like an abandoned basement with no visitors in sight. The facility’s deteriorating continues, the lights getting dimmer before one of the guards speak up, the look on his face stern but enough distressed to keep him on edge.","Something’s wrong here. If they wanted to move in by now they","would’ve.","Maybe they meant to hit something else.","Then we wouldn’t be sitting here damn near in the dark. No,","no, no...","The entire facility blacks out, their floor included before the guards manage to get their hands on their rifles, immediately illuminating their floor with the attached flashlights and standing guard at the elevator, unsure of any intruder but ready to blast away anything that could possibly make it’s way down there. In the midst of the silence there are screams below, enough to unsettle either veteran past the hopes of this being another drill.","Page 12","Cut to the inside of our darkened cell, overviewing our prisoner seemingly enjoying the rest of his slop of a meal more out of survival than delicacy in his corner away from the door. Once he’s finished, he can tell his stay is over, the hellish battle littered with screams and gunshots on the floor beneath him making him stand to his feet, turning to the door behind him in absolute patience.","Page 13","The guards remain on point, undeterred by the noise below them until there’s another commotion, this time from the floor above them. Both guards take a nervous look above them before one of the guards make note of the occasion.","What the hell is going on up there? They usually attack in groups but never on different floors simultaneously.","I know, something’s not right here....","Guard 2’s eyes widen before coming to realization.","They’re not the one’s doing this.","Immediately afterwards a solitary BEEP comes from down the hallway, the keycard slot next to a celldoor turning a flashing green to show not all electricity had been cut off in the facility but most under the influence of someone else outside, someone utterly beyond the standard power of a normal invasion. Both guards’ reflex causes them to do a complete 180, now focused on the hallway where for the first time in their duty a subject has somehow gotten the opportunity to escape.","Page 14","The entire hall is dark, save for the flashlights beaming off of the guards’ weaponry.","The guards remain in position, defending themselves in their stationary location while aiming down the hallway, fingers already clutched to the trigger and ready to fire at any second the prisoner challenges their safety.","As far as they can see, the cell door gently creeps open, no prisoner to accompany it but the two know their lives are still in question. It acts as a waiting game at first, both parties knowledgable to the danger they’re in, the deciding factor of who would win being levied by the elevator behind the guards chiming in, resulting in their sudden surprise quick turn, expecting someone within only to find an empty space, the perfect window. You can see the guards’ eyes widen before they’re able to turn, but by the time they can assemble their aim, it’s too late.","Page 15 & 16","Two page spread. Full frontal attack.","The guards have the look of fear and anguish painted across their face due to good reason; another human being has his hands piercing their throats.","You can see the muscles of the patient in work from the back, displaying a physical prowess usually unseen by normal human beings as it seems his hands are in the process of crushing both of the guard’s airways and vocal cords within one fell swoop, the blood already leaking onto his hands and towards his wrist.","Both soldiers are swept up from their feet before it’s a straight fall down, from the patient’s grasp and from their grasp of consciousness.","Page 17","The challengers aren’t just slammed but carried down with a swiftness. Their eyes remain open from the sudden connotation that those were their final minutes but have no way to react past acceptance.","The escapee’s face remains as apathetic as it was in his cell, calm and collected through the collection of two lives. He finishes his deed as he hears the final signal of the guard’s necks utterly snapping. All you see is his still face complete the deed as quickly as possible before remaining on-task.","He enters the elevator in haste, turning to face the controls with a list of floors from E to B, the numbers in between listed from 1 to 16. The obvious choice would be the top selection for E, the doors closing in pace before the machinery starts to churn it’s way through the first few floors into hundreds of meters in construction to reach it’s destination.","Page 18","By the time the elevator stops, the doors open to reveal a butchery. It seems the time allocated to release the one passenger was previously used to release the other floors as well, the aftermath of their attempt littering the floor with bodies scattered through the final hallway.","The cause of their demise is apparent by the time the patient","looks at the end of the hallway. Two turrets stand at the other end, both seemingly functional and contributing towards a doubt, maybe his stretch of luck had finally ended.","The patient dives out beneath the bodies in attempt to hide, staying in the elevator a moment longer possibly resulting in the end of his run like the others. Before the turrets can identify a heat signature among their makings, another electronic shortage takes out the building, allowing the patient a moment to make it to the lift and escape the residing complex. From that machinery, there’s only one way from there and he takes it to journey upwards towards whatever place he can escape to next.","Page 19","This setting is new, or new enough. Panning across, the scenery depicts the basement of a household, disheveled and unorganized. The previous homeowners items remain stagnant, marked boxes of clothes, appliances, and toys possibly sitting there for as long as the facility has been as a type of cover. Metal shelves are leaning towards each other, dust has gathered, everything remains still until there’s a movement with the concrete walls, opening inwards to give space to the lift and it’s one occupant.","His first few steps out were spent immediately surveying his","environment, quick looks around in the first apparently normal surrounding he’s seen since his supposed conception. His next efforts were centered towards the dormant clothing boxes, assembling the closest thing to an outfit with a rough pair of oversized sweat pants and a white ragged and dust stained t-shirt.","Page 20","The character turns a corner to reveal a shade of crimson coming from the surface. There’s a moment hesitation of what could possibly await him next before he continues his journey, what is found is nothing less than uninhibited destruction.","What used to be a standing two-story home full of the necessities of an Ikea catalogue is now nothing more than rubble, the blast radius of whatever could have caused the event seen not too far away alongside neighboring pillars of a time that used to resemble peace.","The crimson light beaming turns out not to be just an anomaly of strange lighting but the current state of the sky. The previous blue covering the atmosphere replaced by long streaks of red and orange next to the dark gray clouds, contributing to the overall image that the new situation is already under as bad of a condition as the prison the patient just left.","His standing analyzation is cut short by an unknown presence, his distraction causing him to be sideswiped by a figure knocking him flat to the floor, grasp onto his neck and completely pinned and at the mercy of whoever his assailant is.","Page 21","He stares into the eyes of a black hooded character with a mask, designed in a tainted silver metal, obviously worn out and used thoroughly by the faded scratch marks coating around it’s edges and a distinctive deep mark around the left eye. The fashion is similar to a stylistic airsoft mask, only this time the marks were paved through blood instead of manufacturing.","The look on his own face is sated with frustration, still trying to squirm in hopes of overpowering his captor but finding that to fault fairly easily.","Calm down. If I wanted you dead or otherwise, you would be already.","The victim of the scenario stops his movements in assurance of the sentence as well as the fact that if he’d been there to take him back to his cell, he would’ve been knocked out at the very least before even thinking of speaking.","The man in the mask retreats from his stance, standing up beside the prisoner and offering him a hand in reconciliation which he accepts.","Page 22","The new stranger makes the first move, the recent associate behind him only having the choice to follow him towards what seems like a walk into a wasteland only to stop a few meters out.","The patient looks around for a moment to see the grasping of an invisible handle, opening a doorway among a completely crumbled surrounding that leads to a set of steps and a light area. The leader of the situation steps in comfortably, the man behind him waiting behind in hesitation.","You need answers, shelter, and a way to.... Not die, we start here.","With no time to take in the situation or consider an alternate option, it’s deeper down the rabbit hole in hopes of finding any solution to what this new patient has stepped into.","Page 23 & 24","Two page spread. The steps give way to what seems like the inside of an RV or tour bus, spacey enough to accommodate a group of travelers but seems mostly stranded with the exception of two others outside the recent arrival.","Accommodation to the left marks the standard fridge and microwave combo next to the series of bunk beds behind them and the shelves and counters next to them. There’s additional space for a few pieces of furniture in the middle but it’s mainly taken up by what seems to be a work desk cluttered with the occupant right next to it following his masked partner next to him and the driver’s section of the vehicle.","The introduced male is sitting in an office rolling chair, positioned now towards the new arrival, glasses on his face jostled by the surprised look of a familiar, one he was sure was dead at that.","Max?"],"labels":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}

But he had the class and dignity to come into our clubhouse and wish Jeff and I good luck in the second round. That's just class - you don't teach that. Pedro, you brought your A-game out there every time you pitched. You were a little guy, but you pitched like the Big Unit. These guys are Hall of Fame players, but they're better people.","So the big question is: how do you get to the Hall of Fame? You gotta have a little bit of talent and you gotta have a lot of help along the way. My journey started in a little town in Kings Park, New York - not too far from here. I hear you. My mother, Johnna Biggio, and my father, Lee Biggio, were two hardworking people who are no longer here. But I know they're watching. My father was an air traffic controller who hardly ever missed a game. One of the things that he used to like to do was take some rope, tie it around my waist, and then tie it to the backstop and throw me batting practice to try to prevent me from lunging. It worked, but I came home every day with rope burns around my waist. And then my mother: she never missed a game, and unlike most homes, she's the rock. We spent a lot of time together traveling around from field to field. I know she's happy today. I miss you so much, Mom, and I really wish you were here today.","My brother, Terry, and my sister, Gwen: we've been through a lot together. I love you guys. My in-laws, Joe and Yolanda Egan, you were a tremendous help along with your three kids, Joey, Timmy, Kevin. I took their daughter to Texas 25 years ago and we had three kids there. I was very lucky to have a family that was so helpful and supportive as they have been throughout my life. Growing up in Kings Park, I had three responsibilities: school, sports, and I had a job. My job was I had a newspaper route. It was an afternoon newspaper, the Newsday. Because most of the time I didn't get home until 7 or 7:30, that's when people on my route eventually got the paper. Sorry about that. But on my route, I had a family. The family's name was the Aldens. They had a boy that came down with leukemia. It was right then and there that I understood what a family goes through day in and day out when somebody has to go through this. I made a promise to them, that if I was ever in a situation or position to give back, I would. Thus, I'm the national spokesperson for The Sunshine Kids. It's an organization that helps kids with cancer and their families. The Sunshine Kids are a big part of my life and one of the reasons why I stayed in Houston for 20+ years and continue to live there today.","My memories growing up in Kings Park are great. I had a lot of great people around me. My football and baseball coaches were hardworking and very supporting people. My first chance to get noticed by schools and scouts was when I played for a guy in Long Island named Marty Hasenfuss, who coached the Sachem A's, a Connie Mack team. He was an air traffic controller like my father and getting the chance to play for Marty was the first big opportunity I had to be noticed. I had a chance to be drafted at high school by the Detroit Tigers, but I decided to go to college. I went to Seton Hall University, where I met my wife, Patty, and had three great years there. My college coach was Mike Sheppard. He was a tough man - he was a Marine. He was a disciplinarian, but he kept you in line. Most of all, he loved his players and he had their backs no matter what. The man had 999 wins and had hundreds of players get drafted. Coach Shep's motto was \"never lose your hustle,\" which is something I took to my pro career. I'm very grateful to have played for you, Shep. Thank you. Ed Blankmeyer was the assistant coach and he was a tremendous teacher of the game. A man who has dedicated his life to college athletics and has done an incredible job at St. John's University as the head baseball coach. Thanks, Blanky, and keep up the good work. Fred Hopke was the hitting coach. He was a career minor leaguer for ten seasons. He brought a pro style approach to the program. He's the first person that taught me how to work myself through an at-bat. Thanks, Hop. Monsignor Sullivan was the baseball chaplain. He was my roommate on the road at times, but most importantly, he was a friend. He helped me with my conversion to Catholicism when I was going through a tough time in my life. I miss you very much.","My teammates in college, we had a lot of fun together in the three years I was there. We had a good run, especially my last year. In a regional, we beat Frank Thomas's team, then lost to Billy Spiers' team - he's out here somewhere - 2-1, and then we lost to Frank's team again. My memories in college are great whenever I look back on them.","I had a man named Clary Anderson draft me in 1987. Clary is legendary in New Jersey as a great football coach. He was our national cross-checker for the Astros. He gave me a shot and I'll never forget that. I had two owners in John McMullen and Drayton McLane. John McMullen was more than an owner; he was like a father figure to me. We did a lot of things together off the field. Dr. McMullen kept baseball in Houston when the franchise was struggling. How many owners come watch a prospect work out in the gym in the middle of winter? Dr. McMullen and Hall of Famer Yogi Berra did that. I was drafted by the Houston Astros in the first round the following spring. And Drayton McLane: we spent 17 years together, we built a new stadium, we built a successful organization, but most importantly, I was able to stay with one organization for 20 years. I was loyal to Drayton and he was loyal in return. Drayton, you were my boss and my owner, but most importantly, you were my friend.","I was lucky to have some incredible coaches and managers. Like a lot of successful organizations, you're only gonna be successful with good people around you. One of those coaches was Hall of Famer Yogi Berra. Yogi was the smartest baseball man that I was ever around. Although he's known for his Yogi-isms, his baseball intellect was second to none. Yogi would say things in a Yogi way, that he'd walk by and say some things and I'd be confused. And then the next half inning, the one thing would happen, and then the next half inning, the other thing would happen, and then I sat back down on the bench and said, \"oh my gosh, I got a lot to learn about this game.\" Yogi used to say you have to have an idea and a plan, but at the end of the day, keep it simple, stupid.","And then there was Matt Galante, my coach for many years. Matty, where you at? Where you at, Matty? Stand up, Matty. I'm not here without that man. Give him a round of applause, please. Matt, you're an incredible coach and teacher of the game. In the National League, you gotta play offense and defense or you don't play at all. I just made the All-Star Game as a catcher and the following year, the Astros asked me to go play second base, a position that I never played before in my life. We had 6 weeks to learn it in Spring Training. No pressure, huh, Matt? A typical day with Matty is that we started at 7 AM, and we'd go to a half field when the sun was coming up and we would work for an hour and a half, until 8:45. At 8:45, then we'd go practice with the team from 9 till around noon. Then we'd go grab a sandwich, we'd go back to the half field again, get some more work done. Then we'd go back, play the game, and when the game was over, we went back to the half field again. We did that every day in Spring Training for 6 weeks. I thank God for Matt Galante and I'm so grateful. When I won my first Gold Glove, I gave it to him. Matt, thank you for everything. For being a great coach, a great teacher, but a better person and a better friend.","I want to thank all the clubhouse guys, the true heartbeat of the team. Dennis Liborio was the first man that I met in the big leagues. Truly one of my best friends. The first time I met him, I walked in the clubhouse and I asked him where Yogi Berra was. He said, \"who the bleep are you? Your locker's over there\" and he turned and walked away from me. That was the beginning of our relationship. He can't be here today. I hope he knows in his heart how much I love him and I miss him.","I had some pretty special teammates over 20 years, especially my early years where they were the most impressionable. I was around guys like Nolan Ryan, Billy Doran, Buddy Bell, Terry Puhl. Being around these guys taught me how to respect the game and play the game the right way, day in and day out. It was always about the team. Ken Caminiti was a great teammate and a better friend, and I miss him a lot. Nancy, Kendall, Lindsey, and Nicole: your father has given us an amazing relationship. Darryl Kile had the best curveball I'd ever seen. Brad Ausmus, a true friend. Moises Alou, one of the greatest hitters I've ever played with. Jeff Bagwell, another East Coast kid who just loved to play the game. We played 15 years together and changed the culture in Houston by making it a baseball town. We both got to live our dreams together by playing in the big leagues side-by-side. Thanks for being here today, it really means a lot.","I want to thank my agent, Barry Axelrod. One of the most important ingredients in success is your agent. We've been through a lot together over the last 25 years. I had great confidence in you. Your hard work and professionalism were part of my ability to stay with one team my entire career. Barry was always just a phone call away - not just for me, but for all his clients. I'm very grateful for all that you have done and continue to do, but most of all, your friendship. John Palguta, my family and I could not have done this without you, thank you, brother.","To my close friends: the Heberts, Tony, the union crew, Iliana, my friends at St. Thomas, and the late Monsignor Jamail. I want to thank you for supporting me in my professional and personal life.","To the Astros fans, where you at? Let me hear you. Pedro's gonna give you a run for the money. There you go. There you go. You guys are the greatest fans in the world. Man, I love you guys. I want to thank you for the way you've treated my family and I. I hope that I earned your respect by the way that I played the game, and I never took that for granted. I will never forget the playoff runs that we had and the 20 years of memories.","To my family: the most important thing to me in my life. Conor, a graduate from Notre Dame. A four-year letterman on the baseball team. I'm so proud of the man that you have become. And the man can type - he typed his for me in like 20 minutes. Cavan, I am so proud of you and your work ethic on and off the field. I'm so proud of the man that you're becoming on and off the field as far as a student-athlete. Cavan just got here last night around midnight. He was very fortunate enough to make the Cape Cod League All-Star team and played in the game last night and then got his way up here, so I love you, Cav: congratulations. Very proud of you. How lucky was I? I'll never forget the memories that we had traveling with the team. When you guys were bat boys and enjoying the 3000 hits on the field together. Memories of a lifetime. And to Quinn: you are beautiful and talented. Although you were young and may not remember me in my playing career, you sure play like you do. I'm looking forward to your bright future. You are a sweetheart and I love you very much. Saved the best for last: to my wife, Patty. You gave me three incredible kids, but most of all, you gave me my best friend the last 25 years. You are a great person, and our kids are who they are because of you. The baseball life is a great life, but it's a very hard life. I was always in and out for 8 months. You were the one who did everything for the kids. You were a mom, a dad, hitting coach, the driver, the list goes on. But most of all, you were there and made things normal for our kids.","And last: I gave the game everything I had every day. In baseball, tomorrow is not guaranteed, and I tried to play every game as if it was gonna be my last. I wanna thank the game for everything. The game has given me everything. My family, my friends, respect, but most of all, memories of a lifetime. Thank you very, very much, from the bottom of my heart."],"labels":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}
